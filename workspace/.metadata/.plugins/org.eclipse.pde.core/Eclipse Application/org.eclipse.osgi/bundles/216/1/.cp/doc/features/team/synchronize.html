    <p>The standard Application Developer/Eclipse CVS synchronize commands are very manually intensive and
    cumbersome to use. If you want to synchronize a large number of items (possibly across
    multiple projects), you are forced to control/shift-click each item, select the &quot;Team
    | Synchronize with Stream&quot; command, wait for the analysis to take place and then
    manually catch up and release any items that have changed.</p>
    <p>CodePro adds a number of enhanced, fast-path synchronize options based on
    working sets. <a href="../wizards/working_set.html">Working sets</a> are simply
    pre-defined collections of arbitrary resources. Rather than individually selecting each
    element every time you want to synchronize, you can define a working set representing
    those elements and then synchronize that set of elements with a single click. Not only do
    these options make it easier to specify the set of items that are synchronized, they also
    stream-line the actual synchronization process. Updated resources are automatically either
    released or caught up as necessary with the results shown in a simple details dialog.</p>

    <p>If no changes are detected, you will receive the standard notification to that effect.</p>

    alt="synchronize_results_same.gif (7660 bytes)"></p>
    <p>In the event of a conflict, you will be presented with the standard Team perspective
    Synchronize view where you can review the conflict manually. If you would prefer to always
    see the Synchronize view so you can catch up/release changes manually, you can configure that via
    a <a href="../../preferences/preferences_team.html">preference page</a>.</p>

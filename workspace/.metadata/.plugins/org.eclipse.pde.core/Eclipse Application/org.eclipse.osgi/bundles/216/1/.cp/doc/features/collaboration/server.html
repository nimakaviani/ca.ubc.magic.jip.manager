      <p>The <i> collaboration server</i> is a machine accessible by collaboration
      clients over a network, and that is running an instance of the Eclipse
      platform (the <font face="Courier New" size="2"> eclipse.exe</font> executable)
      that in turn is running the
      CodePro collaboration server application (using the <font face="Courier New" size="2">-application</font>
      argument) . The clients send requests to this machine,
      which the collaboration server application processes, returning the
      desired results to the clients.</p>
      <p>For brevity, in what follows the term "server" will often be used instead of
      the phrase "collaboration server application" except where that would cause confusion.</p>
      <h3>System Requirements</h3>
      <p>The collaboration server will comfortably support 25 simultaneous users
      on a machine with the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processor speed: 500 MHz</li>
        <li>Memory size: 256 Mb</li>
        <li>Disk capacity: 20 Gb (100Mb free space needed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Larger user populations may require a correspondingly more powerful
      machine. Supporting more simultaneously active users will tend to require
      more memory and higher processor speed. Supporting more user accounts will
      tend to require more disk capacity.</p>
      <h3>Installation</h3>
      <p>A server installation consists of an Eclipse 2.1 installation and the
      server components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the CodePro collaboration server plug-in(s);</li>
        <li>the open-source Koi plug-ins that implement the underlying services;</li>
        <li>batch files for initializing and running the server</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These components are in the file CodeProCollaborationServer_for_Eclipse2.1.zip.</p>
      <p>Note that the collaboration server can communicate with clients using
      any version of Eclipse including 3.0 and 3.1.</p>
      <p>If the Eclipse installation will only be used to execute the server,
      then a number of Eclipse plug-ins are not needed (the JDT plug-ins, for
      example). The file CodeProCollaborationServer_complete.zip
      contains
      such a stripped-down Eclipse 2.1 installation together with the server
      components. Thus, it is a complete server installation.</p>
      <p>To install the server, either</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unzip CodeProCollaborationServer_for_Eclipse2.1.zip
          into the
          root directory of an Eclipse 2.1 installation (C\eclipse, for
          example); or</li>
        <li>unzip CodeProCollaborationServer_complete.zip into any
          directory (<font face="Courier New" size="2">C:\</font>, for example)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <font face="Courier New" size="2">eclipse\cpsws-server</font>
      directory contains the files related to starting the server.</p>
      <h3>Configuration</h3>
      <p>The <font face="Courier New" size="2">.conf</font> files in <font face="Courier New" size="2">eclipse\cpsws-server\conf</font>
      provide the server configuration information. They specify how to start
      Eclipse running the server. As described in this section, very little in
      these files should need to be changed to set up the server. However,
      sophisticated users may have reasons to alter them more extensively. See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wrapper">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wrapper</a>
      for more information on them.</p>
      <p>The supplied server configuration assume a Java interpreter (<font face="Courier New" size="2">java.exe</font>)
      is on the system path. If that is not the case, set the value of the <font face="Courier New" size="2">wrapper.java.command</font>
      property to the location of the desired Java interpreter in the
      configuration files.</p>
      <h3>Execution</h3>
      <p>Using the batch files in the <font face="Courier New" size="2">eclipse\cpsws-server</font>
      directory, the server can either be run manually, or set up as a Windows
      service to run automatically whenever the machine is booted.</p>
      <p>To run the server manually, execute the <font face="Courier New" size="2">run.bat</font>
      script. A console window will appear to indicate the server is running. Closing
      this window stops the server. The console shows the last time a user's
      workspace contacted the server. It also displays a rolling list of
      transactions which can give a good indication whether the server is
      operating properly or if a user's workspace is properly communicating with
      the server.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/collaboration/console.jpg" border="0" height="550" width="518"></p>
      <p>To install the server as a Windows service, execute the <font face="Courier New" size="2">install.bat</font>
      script. To start the server, either reboot the machine, or use the
      services administration utility (typically invoked by the <b>Start</b>
      button menu item <b>Programs/Administrative Tools/Services</b>). To
      uninstall the service, execute the <font face="Courier New" size="2">uninstall.bat</font>
      script, or use the services administration utility. When the server is
      running, a window is displayed. Closing this window stops the server,
      although the same result can be achieved using the services administration
      utility.</p>
      <p>It is often desirable to run the server in <i> open enrollment mode</i>.
      In this mode, the server allows people to
      create user and group accounts for themselves, thus easing the burden on
      the administrator, who would otherwise have to perform this task. On the
      client side, the collaboration preferences <a href="configuration_wizard.html">configuration
      wizard</a> can take advantage of open enrollment mode by providing the
      opportunity for users to add themselves. To make the server run in open
      enrollment mode, simply use the "open" versions of the scripts
      named above: <font face="Courier New" size="2">run-open.bat</font>, <font face="Courier New" size="2">install-open.bat</font>,
      and <font face="Courier New" size="2">uninstall-open.bat</font>.</p>
      <p>Because there is no way to specify the port to use, having more than
      one server instance running on a machine at a time is not currently
      possible. This restriction will be lifted in future releases.</p>
      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <p>The server keeps the database files and other items it uses in an
      Eclipse workspace, which by default is <font face="Courier New" size="2">eclipse\cpsws-server-data</font>.
      This is specified by the argument to the Eclipse <font face="Courier New" size="2">-data</font>
      option, which corresponds to the <font size="2"><font face="Courier New">wrapper.app.parameter.5</font></font>
      property in the configuration files<font size="2">.</font></p>
      <p>Those wishing to run the collaboration server on non-Windows platforms such as Linux can use the
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">basic.bat</font> script as a model. It shows the
      basic Windows
      command line for starting the server.</p>

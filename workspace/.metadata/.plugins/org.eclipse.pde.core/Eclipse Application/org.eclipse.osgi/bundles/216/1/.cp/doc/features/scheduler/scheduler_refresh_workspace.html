    <p>To schedule a refresh of the workspace (similar to what the -refresh command line option
    does) to be run at a specified time, open the <a href="scheduler.html">scheduler view</a>,
    right click to access the popup menu, select the &quot;New&quot; submenu, and then select
    &quot;Refresh Workspace&quot;. In addition to refreshing the workspace, it will also scan
    for and recognize and new Eclipse projects that were created externally to Eclipse (either
    by hand or via VA Assist when Eclipse was not running).</p>
    <p>Click the &quot;<a href="scheduler_schedule.html">Next &gt;</a>&quot; button to
    schedule when the refresh is to occur.</td>

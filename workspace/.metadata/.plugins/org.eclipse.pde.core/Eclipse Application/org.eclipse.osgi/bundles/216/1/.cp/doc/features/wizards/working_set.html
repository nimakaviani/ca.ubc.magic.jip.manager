    <p>Working sets are simply pre-defined collections of arbitrary resources that can be used
    for various tasks such as:<ul>
      <li>Search Scopes</li>
      <li><a href="../vaj/vaj_perspective.html#workingset">Resource Filters</a></li>
      <li><a href="../team/synchronize.html">CVS Synchronization</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Creating or Editing a Working Set</h3>
    <p>The Working Set dialog shows all of the working sets know to the system and allows one
    to be selected. The &quot;New&quot; button is used to create a new working set; the
    &quot;Edit&quot; button is used to edit an existing working set; and the
    &quot;Remove&quot; button is used to delete a working set.</p>

    <p>The Working Set Details dialog is used to define or edit the contents of either a new
    or existing working set. All of the projects in the system are shown a tree list. Any
    combination of resources may be selected at any granularity. When you are done, click the
    &quot;OK&quot; button to save the working set.</p>

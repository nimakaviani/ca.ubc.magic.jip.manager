          <p class="MsoNormal">The <b>JUnit Test Case Outline</b> view shows the
          contents of a <a href="test_case_generation.html">JUnit Test Case</a>
          structured in a way that is more convenient for certain kinds of
          browsing.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">One of the primary advantages of this view is
          that it groups each of the test methods based on the target method
          that is being tested. This not only makes it easier to see which
          target methods are being tested and how many test methods there are
          for each one, it also helps you find all of the test methods that are
          testing each target method, no matter where they are located in the
          file and no matter what they might be named.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, this view helps you locate several
          vital pieces of information about each test method, such as the
          fixture being used, the values being passed in to the target method,
          and the tests that will be applied to the resulting value.</p>
          <h2>Outline Structure</h2>
          <p class="MsoNormal">The top level elements in the tree represent
          individual classes that are, either directly or indirectly, subclasses
          of <span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;" class="Code">junit.framework.TestCase</span>.
          The children of these test classes are either test fixtures or groups
          of test methods.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">A test fixture is a field whose type is the same
          as the target type (the type being tested). Its children include the
          accessor method used to get its value, if there is one, and the value
          assigned to the field.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
      <p class="MsoNormal">As stated previously, test methods are grouped
      together based on the target method being tested. The label for the groups
      contains the name of the target method and the number of test methods
      within the group. The children are individual test methods.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Each test method has two children representing the
      inputs to the test method, including the test fixture on which the method
      will be invoked, and the results of the test. The results consist of
      either the exception that is expected to be thrown by the test method or
      the sequence of assertions that will be tested after the method has
      returned.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Test methods are marked (currently by being displayed
      in a red font) if the results of the test have not been verified.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../../images/test_case_sample1.gif" width="390" height="227">
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Deleting or commenting out the <b>fail</b> line will
      mark the method as verified.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../../images/test_case_sample2.gif" width="390" height="227"></p>
      <h2>Menu Items</h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">
		<img border="0" src="../../images/test_case_mark_verified.gif" width="126" height="28"><p class="MsoNormal">
	The <b>Mark Verified</b> menu item (and a corresponding
      action bar button) will automatically remove from a test method the
      marker used to indicate that the method has not yet been verified. This
      will make it easier for developers to mark tests as having been verified.

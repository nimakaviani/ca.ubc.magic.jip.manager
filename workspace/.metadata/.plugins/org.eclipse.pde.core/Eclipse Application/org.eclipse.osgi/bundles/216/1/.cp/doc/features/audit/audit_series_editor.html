      		<p align="left">The <b>Audit Series</b> editor is a multi-tabbed editor that allows you to edit
        an audit series. An audit series is a <a href="audit_series_report.html">report</a> based on a series of audit
        result sets. The first tab, shown below, allows you to specify which
        audit result sets are included in the <a href="audit_series_report.html">report</a>.
      </td>
			<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>

      </p>
      <p>
        You can either automatically include all of the audit result sets in the
        same storage location as the audit series or you can provide an explicit
        list of audit result sets. Unless you have a need to store the results
        of audits of different code bases in the same project, automatically
        including the audit result sets is the easiest solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do need to create an audit series for a subset of the available
        audit result sets, you can do so by selecting "Include only the result
        sets below" and adding the desired result sets by dragging them to the
        list from the <a href="audit_explorer.html"><b>Audit Explorer</b> view</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first tab also allows you to specify which graphs are included in
        the report. Each graph type presents a different aspect of the data
        within the audit result sets. Each graph is displayed and configured on
        a separate tab. The list pane on the left contains a list of the types
        of graphs that are currently supported. You can use the "Add" and
        "Remove" buttons to configure the list of graphs in the report, shown
        in the right-hand list pane. You can use the buttons to the right of the
        list of graphs to control the order of the graphs. The same type of
        graph can be included multiple times in case you want the same data to
        be configured in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining tabs allow you to configure the individual graphs. Each
        set of data can typically be displayed in a number of different formats,
        including both graphical and tabular layouts. Some graph types have
        additional configuration options, such as whether or not to display
        grid lines.

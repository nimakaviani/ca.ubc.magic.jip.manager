  <tr>
    <td><h1><font face="Verdana" color="#CC0000"><b>Collaboration Team Task View</b></font>
      </h1>
      <p>This view is for managing team tasks: creating them, assigning them to users and
      groups, and viewing those assigned to the current workbench user.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/team_task_view.gif" width="598" height="223"></p>
      <p>Once created, a team
      task automatically appears in the team task view in the assignees' workbench.
      Only group leaders and the administrator may assign a team task to
      users besides themselves.</p>
      <h3>Tool Bar</h3>
      <p>The tool bar has a button for deleting the selected tasks.</p>
      <p>The tool bar menu contains the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Show Assigned Tasks</b> - Show only the tasks assigned to the
          current workbench user.</li>
        <li><b>Show Managed Tasks</b> - Show only the tasks that can be deleted
          by the current workbench user. For a non-privileged user, these are
          just the tasks created by the current workbench user. However, for the administrator,
          these are all of the team tasks; for a group leader, these are the
          team tasks assigned to
      the groups led.</li>
        <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refresh this view from the collaboration server.
          The view automatically updates the assigned tasks in response to changes on the
          server, but not managed tasks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team Task List</h3>
      <p>The columns in this list show the task identifier, summary, state, and
      severity. If open,
      the properties view shows additional information about the selected task,
      such as to whom it is assigned and who created it.</p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">The context menu contains the following items
            <ul>
              <li><b>New Task</b> - Open a blank <a href="team_task_editor.html"> team task
                editor</a>.</li>
              <li><b>Edit</b> - Open a <a href="team_task_editor.html"> team task
                editor</a> on the selected task.</li>

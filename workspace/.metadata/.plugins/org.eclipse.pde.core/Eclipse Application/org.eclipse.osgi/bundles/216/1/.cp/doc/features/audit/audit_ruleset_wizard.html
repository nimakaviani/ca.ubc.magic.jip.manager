    <p>The Audit Rule Set Wizard allows you to create new audit rule sets.</p>
   	
   	<p>It can be reached from the <b>CodePro &gt; Audit</b> preferences page 
   	or from the <b>File &gt; New &gt; Other...</b> menu item.</p>

		<h3>General Rules</h3>
    	<img src="../../images/audit_ruleset_1.gif">
    	
    	<br/>The <b>General Rules</b> tab allows you to name the new rule set.
    	You can also select from a group of pre-defined	audit rule sets. Once you have
    	a new, unique name for the audit rule set, you can either finish the wizard 
    	immediately or continue on to the next tab.
	</p>

		<h3>JEE Rules</h3>
    	<img src="../../images/audit_ruleset_2.gif">
    	
    	<br/>The <b>JEE Rules</b> tab allows you to select from various pre-defined
    	JEE related audit rule sets.
	</p>
	
    <p>
		<h3>Preview Audit Results</h3>
    	<img src="../../images/audit_ruleset_3.gif">
    	
    	<br/>The <b>Preview Audit Results</b> tab allows you to test your new audit rule set
    	against existing projects in your workspace. You can view the audit results and
    	decide which rules actually make sense to run against your existing codebase.
    	<p>
    	In order to preview the audit results, select one or more projects from the table on the
    	left and choose the <b>Perform Audit</b> button. The audit will run, and
    	the audit results will be displayed in the table on the right. The audit
    	results will be sorted by the number of violations per rule. To disable an audit
    	rule de-select the checkbox next to it. To configure an audit rule, double click on it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>
    	<img src="../../images/audit_ruleset_4.gif">
    	
    	<br/>The <b>Advanced Configuration</b> tab allows you to custom configure your
    	audit rule set. You can enable or disable individual rules, and custom configure rules
    	as appropriate to your development environment.

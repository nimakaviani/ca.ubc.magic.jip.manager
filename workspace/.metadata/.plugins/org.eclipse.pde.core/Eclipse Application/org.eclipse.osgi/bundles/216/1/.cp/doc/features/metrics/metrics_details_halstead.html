      metrics..</p>
    <!-- *********************************************************************** -->
    <h3> Difficulty</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is a measure of difficulty. It is computed by</p>
      <p><i>([Number Of Unique Operators] / 2) * ([Number Of Operands] / [Number
      Of Unique Operands])</i></p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Effort</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is a measure of effort. It is computed by</p>
      <p><i>[Difficulty] * [Program Volume]</i></p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Number of Operands</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the number of operands used in the scope.</p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Number of Operators</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the number of operators used in the scope.</p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Number of Unique Operands</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the number of unique operands used in the scope.</p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Number of Unique Operators</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the number of unique operators used in the scope.</p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Program Length</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is an estimation of the size of the program. It is computed by</p>
      <p><i>[Number Of Operators] + [Number Of Operands]</i></p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Program Vocabulary</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is an estimation of the size of the program's vocabulary (the
      number of things that must be known to understand the program). It is
      computed by</p>
      <p><i>[Number Of Unique Operators] + [Number Of Unique Operands]</i></p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Program Volume</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is an estimation of the size of the program. It is computed by</p>
      <p><i>[Program Length] * log2([Program Vocabulary])</i></p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>

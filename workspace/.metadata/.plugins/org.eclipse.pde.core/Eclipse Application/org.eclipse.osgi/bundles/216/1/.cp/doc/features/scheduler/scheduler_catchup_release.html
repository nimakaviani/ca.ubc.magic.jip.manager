    <p>To schedule a <a href="../team/synchronize.html">CVS Catch Up &amp; Release Working Set</a>
    task to be run at a specified time, open the <a href="scheduler.html">scheduler view</a>,
    right-click to access the popup menu, select the &quot;New&quot; submenu, and then select
    &quot;Catch Up/Release Working Set&quot;.&nbsp; This opens the scheduler wizard so that
    catch-up/release working set operation may be configured. All resources and <a
    href="../wizards/working_set.html">Working Sets</a> known to the system are shown in the
    list on each tab page. If you wish to create a new working set or edit an existing one, click the
    &quot;New/Browse&quot; button on the Working Set page. In the event of conflicts, options are provided to do
    nothing, open a conflict view, catch up/release only non-conflicts, or catch up/release
    everything while treating conflicts as either incoming or outgoing.</p>
    <p>Click the &quot;<a href="scheduler_schedule.html">Next &gt;</a>&quot; button to
    schedule when the message is to be displayed.</td>

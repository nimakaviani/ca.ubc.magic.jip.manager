    <p>This page is used to control various startup options.</p>
    <h3>Refresh workspace and scan for new projects</h3>
    <p>This option schedules a special system task to run at startup that will refresh the
    workspace (similar to what the -refresh command line option does). In addition to
    refreshing the workspace, it will also scan for and recognize new Eclipse projects
    that were created externally to Eclipse.</p>
    
    <h3>Show CodePro menu</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether the <a href="../codepro_menu.html">CodePro menu</a> is
    added to the main menu bar. The CodePro menu provides convenient access to many CodePro
    functions (i.e., perspectives and views), help and on-line web and e-mail
    links.</td>

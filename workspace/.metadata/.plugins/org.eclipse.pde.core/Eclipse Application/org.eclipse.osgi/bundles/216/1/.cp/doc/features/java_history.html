    <p>The CodePro Java History view tracks all types that have been accessed within
    the workspace. The types may be deleted or sorted by name, package, time of access.
    Selecting a type in the list will open an editor and focus it on the code for the type.</p>
    <p>Options are provided via a <a href="../preferences/preferences_history.html">preference
    page</a> to show only the most recent <em>n</em> number of types and/or only those types
    accessed in the specified time period (e.g., the last week, the last <em>n</em> days,
    etc.).<h3>Early Startup</h3>
    <p>In order that CodePro track accessed types, this plugin must be
    <a href="early_startup.html">loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched</a>.</td>

    <p>The CodePro Modified Member view tracks all modifications or additions made to
    various types within the workspace. The members may be deleted or sorted by name,
    enclosing type, package, time of modification or type of modification (e.g., added or
    modified). Selecting a member in the list will open an editor and focus it on the code for
    the member.</p>
    <p>Options are provided via a <a href="../preferences/preferences_history.html">preference
    page</a> to show only the most recent <em>n</em> number of members and/or only those
    members modified in the specified time period (e.g., the last week, the last <em>n</em>
    days, etc.).</td>

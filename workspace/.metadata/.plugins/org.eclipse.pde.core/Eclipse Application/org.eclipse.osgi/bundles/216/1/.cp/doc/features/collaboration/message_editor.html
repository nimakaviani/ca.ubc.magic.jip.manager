      </h1>
      <p>This editor is for creating a message and its attachments, and to send
      the message.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/message_editor.gif" width="487" height="324"></p>
      <p><b>To Button</b></p>
      <p>This button opens a dialog for selecting the users and groups to which
      to send the message. These are displayed in the field next to the button.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/recipients_users.gif" width="232" height="346">
      <img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/recipients_groups.gif" width="232" height="346"></p>
      <p><b>Attach Button</b></p>
      <p>This button opens a dialog for selecting the types of attachments the
      message will have. By default, a message has a text attachment containing
      the text of the message. </p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/select_attachments.gif" width="221" height="174"></p>
      <p><a name="SettingsAttachment"></a>The attachments are shown in the
      message content section (see below). Workbench settings may be sent as an
      attachment. The setting interface is the same as presented in the <a href="../prefs/export_prefs.html">Export
      Preferences wizard</a>.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/message_editor_settings.gif" width="487" height="324"></p>
      <p><a name="TaskAttachment"></a>Any scheduled task created in the <a href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">Scheduler
      view</a> may also be sent as an attachment.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/message_editor_tasks.gif" width="487" height="324"></p>
      <p><b>Send Button</b></p>
      <p>This button sends the message to the specified recipients.</p>
      <p><b>Auto Apply Check Box</b></p>
      <p>If this is checked, then any attachments to the message are
      automatically applied upon receipt with no opportunity for the recipient
      to intervene. In other words, recipients are forced to apply the
      attachments.</p>
      <p>This capability is only available to privileged users: group leaders and
      the administrator.</p>
      <p><b>Subject Field</b></p>
      <p>Enter the message subject in this field.</p>
      <p><b>Message Content Section</b></p>
      <p>The tabbed section in the bottom half of the message editor is for
      editing the message. It has a page for editing each attachment. Note that
      text is treated as an attachment, so there will be a page for it.</td>

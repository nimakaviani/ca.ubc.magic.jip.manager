      <p>CodePro includes two key features necessary to support the
      remote administration of multiple workspaces via the CodePro <a href="server.html">collaboration
      server</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remote Preference Configuration</li>
        <li>Remote Project Configuration</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="Preferences"></a>Remote Preference Configuration</h3>
      <p>Configuring multiple user's workspaces with common settings (such as code formatting
    preference, classpath variable settings, etc.) is very difficult due to the
    difficulty in moving general workspace preferences from one workspace to
      another. CodePro makes it easy for users to copy workspace preferences in any granularity
    between multiple workspaces. It also makes it easy for team leaders and administrators to
    set up common sets of preferences for configuring multiple workspaces.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/export_prefs_wizard2.gif" width="470" height="573"></p>
      <p>To export preferences, open the <font face="Arial"><img src="../../images/export_prefs.gif" width="16" height="16">
 </font> <a href="../prefs/export_prefs.html">Export Wizard</a>, select &quot;Preferences&quot; and click
    &quot;Next&quot;. At the top of the wizard is a checkbox tree list showing all of the
    preferences that may be exported. At the bottom of the wizard page, is an area for selecting the location to which the
    preference file should be exported. The fourth option, &quot;User&quot;, allows the user to send preferences to other users without intervention
      by the receiving user. Thus, this option provides a way to silently set
      preferences in the workbenches of other users. This can only be done for <a href="users_view.html">users</a>
      and <a href="groups_view.html">groups</a> led by the
      user, unless the user is the administrator, in which case it can be done
      for any user or group.</p>

      <h3><a name="Projects"></a>Remote Project Configuration</h3>
      <p>Configuring multiple workspaces with the same initial projects is also
      difficult and manually intensive. CodePro includes a <b><img border="0" src="../../images/solutions/solution_proj_new_wiz.gif" width="16" height="16"></b>
      <a href="../scheduler/scheduler_load_projects.html">Load Projects</a> task
      which allows any shared projects to be selected for loading into any
      target workspace. When this task is used as a <a href="shared_task_view.html">globally
      shared task</a>, it provides a way to remotely control the project
      configuration of one or more workspaces. This can only be done for <a href="users_view.html">users</a>
      and <a href="groups_view.html">groups</a> led by the
      user, unless the user is the administrator, in which case it can be done
      for any user or group</p>

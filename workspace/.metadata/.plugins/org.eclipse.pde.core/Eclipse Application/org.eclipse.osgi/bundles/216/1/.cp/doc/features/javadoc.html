        time the menu item <img src="../images/javadoc_icon.gif" width="16" height="16">
        &quot;Repair Javadoc&quot; is selected, the javadoc repair engine is run.<br>
        This computes missing javadoc comments as well as corrections and improvements to existing
        ones, and displays these in a javadoc comparison editor. From there, the suggested changes
        may then be edited and applied, or rejected.</p>
        <p>Options are provided via a <a href="../preferences/preferences_javadoc.html">preference
        page</a> to determine what Java program elements the javadoc repair engine examines, and
        to set the format of generated text. Custom Javadoc tags may also be
        specified.</td>

    <h3>The Compilation Unit Tree</h3>
    <p><img src="../images/javadoc_editor.gif" width="595" height="496"></p>
    <p>The compilation unit tree (shown on the top left in the picture above) shows the
    compilation units within the selected scope for which there are suggested javadoc changes.
    Selecting a compilation unit will show the changes suggested for the elements in that
    compilation unit.</p>
    <p>The context menu contains a menu item for saving the suggested javadoc changes under
    the selection, for expanding the tree and for removing a selection from view.</p>

    <h3>The Structure Tree</h3>
    <p>The structure tree (shown on the top right in the picture above) shows the elements in
    the selected compilation unit for which there are suggested javadoc changes. Selecting an
    element will restrict the comparison view (shown in the bottom half of the picture above)
    to that element. The context menu contains a menu item for expanding the tree. </p>
    <h3>The Comparison View</h3>
    <p>The comparison view (shown in the bottom half of the picture above) shows a comparison
    between the suggested javadoc changes (on the left) and the original version (on the
    right). The text in the left pane may be edited. An option is provided via
    the <a href="../preferences/preferences_javadoc.html">preference
        page</a>  that will cause the original and modified panes in the Javadoc
    editor to be transposed, so that the original code is shown on the left and
    the modified code is shown on the right.</p>
    <p> The context menu contains the usual edit
    menu items.&nbsp;</p>

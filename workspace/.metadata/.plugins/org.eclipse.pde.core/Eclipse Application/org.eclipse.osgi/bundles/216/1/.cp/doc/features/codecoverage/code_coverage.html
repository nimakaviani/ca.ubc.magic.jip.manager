          The Code Coverage tools allow you to measure how much of your code is
          being executed. Probably the most common reason for measuring code
          coverage is to evaluate the effectiveness of test code at exercising
          all possible paths through the code.
          <p></p><p>
          There are two different mechanisms provided. Deciding which one is
          right for your needs depends primarily on the complexity of the code
          being run. The first is designed for use with stand-alone Java
          applications that run in a single VM and do not make use of
          specialized class loaders.

          The second mechanism is designed for arbitrary applications, but might
          require a bit more work to get it set up initially, again depending on
          just how complex the code is. Both mechanisms are described in
          separate sections below.

      <p>
      You can measure the code coverage for a particular piece of code by
      selecting a class that defines a main method and then selecting
      "Run Code Coverage" from the "CodePro Tools"
      submenu. The selected class will then be executed and the results will
      be displayed in the <a href="code_coverage_view.html"><b>Coverage View</b></a>.
      From within the <a href="code_coverage_view.html"><b>Coverage View</b></a>,
      the results may also be exported to various report formats including
      <a href="code_coverage_sample_report.html">HTML</a>, XML and text.
      </p><p>
      The information about how the class is to be run and what kind of coverage
      information to gather is captured in a special kind of
      <a href="code_coverage_launch_configuration.html">launch configuration</a>.
      You can also create the launch configuration manually, but the "Run
      Code Coverage" menu item makes that process easier.
      </p><p>
      Once a launch configuration has been created, you can measure the coverage
      of your code either by using the "Run Code Coverage" menu item
      or by directly executing the
      <a href="code_coverage_launch_configuration.html">launch configuration</a>
      from the "Run" menu.
      </p>
      <h2><a name="FullFeatured"></a>Full Featured Code Coverage</h2>
      <p>
      Code coverage works by instrumenting the bytecodes being loaded by the VM
      to collect data about which bytecodes have been executed. Code run using
      the code coverage launch configuration is instrumented dynamically as it
      is loaded by using a specialized class loader. This class loader becomes
      the default class loader for the VM that is initially executed. If
      additional class loaders are created by the application, or if additional
      VM's are run, they will not perform the dynamic instrumentation necessary
      to collect code coverage information.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <img src="../../images/code_coverage_menu2.gif" align="left">The alternative is to statically instrument the code before executing the
      application. CodePro provides support for instrumenting the code on a
      project-by-project basis. Each project has a
      <a href="code_coverage_properties.html">Code Coverage property sheet</a>.
      This property sheet allows you to control whether the class files are
      to be instrumented. It also allows you to control which class files are
      instrumented. As a convenience, the "Instrument Code" and
      "Uninstrument Code" menu items on the "CodePro Tools"
      submenu will turn instrumentation on and off while leaving the other
      project-related settings unchanged.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Once your projects have been instrumented, you will collect code coverage
      information any time the code is run, using any launch configuration that
      you have created. In other words, you do not need to, and should not, use
      the Code Coverage launch configuration to run pre-instrumented code.
      </p><p>
      There are two other implications of using this mechanism that you need to
      be aware of. The first is that if you want to run the code without
      gathering code coverage data, you will need to uninstrument all of the
      projects containing code that will be executed.
      </p><p>
      The second implication is similar. If you are going to distribute the
      class files from your local machine, you need to be careful to
      uninstrument the code before you package it for delivery. Otherwise the
      code will be collecting code coverage data whenever it is executed.
      </p><h2>Viewing the Results</h2>
      <p>
      Each time you measure a particular class, a coverage report will be
      generated. If you measure the same class multiple times, past versions of
      the report will be remembered so that those versions can be compared. The
      <a href="../../preferences/preferences_code_coverage.html">number
      of versions</a> to be remembered can be configured. Coverage reports are
      stored on disk, so they are available even after Eclipse is closed and
      then re-opened.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/code_coverage_view_history.gif" border="0">
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the Results</h2>
      <p>
      The code coverage data that is gathered measures the number of times each
      basic block has been executed. A <i>basic block</i> is a sequence of one
      or more bytecodes (Java Virtual Machine instructions) that contains at
      most one branch instruction, which must be at the end of the block. The
      important thing about basic blocks is that if one instruction in the block
      is executed, then <b>all</b> of the instructions in the block will be
      executed.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, we keep track of the number of bytecodes in each basic block
      and enough information to be able to map each bytecode back to the class,
      method, and even line of code from which it was compiled.
      </p>
      <p>
      Given this data, we can compute the code coverage at several interesting
      levels of granularity, resulting in the following coverage measures:
      </p>
      <dl>
      <dt>class coverage</dt>
        <dd>
        The number of classes containing at least one basic block that was
        executed at least once, divided by the total number of classes.
        </dd>
      <dt>method coverage</dt>
        <dd>
        The number of methods containing at least one basic block that was
        executed at least once, divided by the total number of methods.
        </dd>
      <dt>line coverage</dt>
        <dd>
        The number of lines of code containing at least one basic block that was
        executed at least once, divided by the total number of lines of code.
        </dd>
      <dt>block coverage</dt>
        <dd>
        The number of basic blocks that were executed at least once, divided by
        the total number of basic blocks.
        </dd>
      <dt>instruction coverage</dt>
        <dd>
        The number of instructions in basic blocks that were executed at least
        once, divided by the total number of instructions.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
      Line coverage is probably the most easily misunderstood measure, because
      while all of the rest of the measured elements (classes, methods, blocks,
      and instructions) all map cleanly to blocks, lines do not necessarily. It
      all depends on how the code is formatted. Each line of code can contain
      either some or all of one or more basic blocks, and every basic block can
      map to one or more lines of code.

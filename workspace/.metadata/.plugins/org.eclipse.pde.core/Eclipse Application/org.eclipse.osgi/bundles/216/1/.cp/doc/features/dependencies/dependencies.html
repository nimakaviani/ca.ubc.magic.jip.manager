        <h3>Dependencies View</h3>
        <p><img src="../../images/dependencies_view_projects.gif" width="815" height="323"></p>
      <p>Dependencies are displayed in a graphical format. The elements visible
      at each level of granularity (projects, packages, or types) are displayed
      as rectangles labeled by both an icon indicating the kind of element being
      viewed and the name of the element. Dependencies between the elements are
      displayed as directed lines (lines with arrows at either one end or both).
      The elements are divided into three groups, which are color coded for ease
      of recognition (the colors can be changed on the <a href="../../preferences/preferences_dependencies.html">Dependencies
      preference</a>  page as well as the line connection style).</p>
      <p>The first group are internal elements, which are elements that were
      either directly selected when the analysis was performed, or elements that
      are contained in directly selected elements. For example, if you were to
      select the package java.util, both the package java.util and the class
      java.util.ArrayList would be internal elements. By default, internal
      elements are displayed in black.</p>
      <p>The second group are external elements, which are elements that were
      neither selected nor contained in selected elements, but that are
      referenced by them. For example, if you were to select the package
      java.util, the interface java.lang.Cloneable would be an external element
      in the type-level graph because the class java.util.ArrayList implements
      it and it is not within the java.util package. No analysis is done on
      external items, so no dependency line will ever originate from an external
      item. By default, external elements are displayed in gray.</p>
      <p>The third group is a subset of the internal elements; those that are
      elements of a strongly connected component. A strongly connected component
      is a set of elements in which it is possible to reach all of the elements
      by following dependencies, starting from any element. In other word, they
      are sets of elements that are mutually dependent on one another. These
      usually represent a problem in the code, so by default they are displayed
      in red. The thickness of each line further indicates whether the
      dependency is bi-directional or not.</p>
      <p>The number of dependencies between nodes can be optionally displayed
      as labels on the connecting lines. If the line is bi-directional, the
      number of dependencies in both directions will be displayed, separated by
      a slash ("/").</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/dependencies_view_packages.gif" width="815" height="323"></p>
      <p>When a dependency analysis is being viewed, finer levels of granularity
      can be accessed by double clicking on some portion of the graph. Double
      clicking on an element will display a graph containing only those elements
      within the element that was clicked on and the elements that they are
      dependent on. This is same as right-clicking and selecting the <b>Explore
      | Contents </b>command. For example, double clicking on a project will display a
      graph consisting of the packages defined within that project and those on
      which those packages depend. Double clicking on external elements is
      disallowed because no dependency information is recorded for external
      elements.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/dependencies_view_types.gif" width="815" height="323"></p>
      <p><a name="Cycles"></a>Double clicking on an element that is part of a strongly connected
      component will, if the shift key is held down, display a graph containing
      the elements within any of the members of the strongly connected
      component. This is same as right-clicking and selecting the <b>Explore |
      Cycle </b>command.</p>
      <p>Double clicking on a dependency line will display a graph consisting of
      those elements from either end of the arrow that have a dependency on
      something on the other end of the arrow. This is same as selecting the
      elements at both ends of the arrow, then right-clicking
      and selecting the <b>Explore | Dependencies</b> command.</p>
      <p>Whenever a new view of the analysis is accessed by double clicking on
      something, the old view is placed on a list. Controls are provided for
      moving backward and forward along the list.</p>
      <p>The following operations are available on the title bar:</p>

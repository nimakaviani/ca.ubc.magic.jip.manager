      <p>When the menu item <img src="../images/javadoc_icon.gif" width="16" height="16">
    &quot;Repair Javadoc&quot; is chosen, the javadoc repair engine is run.<br>
    This computes missing javadoc comments as well as corrections and improvements to existing
    ones, and<br>
    displays these in a<a href="../features/javadoc.html"> javadoc comparison editor</a>.
      Note that when the javadoc repair tool is invoked from an audit violation
      resolution, the <a href="../features/audit/audit_rules_com.instantiations.assist.eclipse.auditGroup.javadocConventions.html">javadoc
      audit rule</a> settings will override the preferences set here. </p>
    <p>The javadoc repair options are grouped according to the Java program elements they
    affect:<ul>
      <li><a href="#All">All</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Fields">Fields</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Methods">Methods</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Types">Types</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Tags">Tags</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="All">All</a></h2>
    <h3>Include '*' column at left of comments</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether an asterisk will be used to start each line in&nbsp; the
    comment. (All javadoc comments must start with &quot;/**&quot; and end with
    &quot;*/&quot;, but the&nbsp; lines in between do not need to start with a '*', although
    by convention they do.)</p>
    <h3>Indentation inside comments (typically a single space)</h3>
    <p>This option determines what characters are used to indent lines inside a comment (after
    the '*' if there is one). Typically, this is a single space.</p>
    <h3>Use qualified type names in method comments</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether qualified type names will be used&nbsp; in @param and
    @see tags. By default, unqualified type names are used.</p>
    <h3>Generate an empty comment even if no tags are generated</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether an empty comment will be generated for Java program
    elements even if no tags are generated. (This arises with&nbsp; fields and simple
    zero-argument methods returning void.)</p>
    <h3>Show the original code on the left and the modified on the right</h3>
      <p>This option causes the original and modified panes in the Javadoc
      editor to be transposed, so that the original code is shown on the left
      and the modified code is shown on the right.</p>
    <h3>Save only manually edited files in response to File&gt;Save</h3>
      <p>This option causes the File&gt;Save command in the Javadoc editor to
      save only manually edited files. Otherwise, all
      files in the editor are saved.</p>
    <h3>Ignore javadoc-related audit disable directives</h3>
      <p>This option causes <a href="../features/audit/locally_disabling_audit_rules.html"> audit disable directives</a> related to javadoc (for example, &quot;// $codepro.audit.disable methodJavadoc&quot;)
      to be ignored. When not ignored, such directives inhibit javadoc repair
      suggestions for the associated Java entity.</p>
    <h3>Make suggestions based on javadoc-related audit rules instead</h3>
      <p>This option causes the preferences in this dialog to be ignored.
      Instead, the javadoc-related audit rules in the audit rule set specified
      in the drop-down list are used to make suggestions regarding javadoc
      repairs.</p>
    <h2><a name="Fields">Fields</a></h2>
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_javadoc_field.gif"></p>
    <h3>Checked Visibility</h3>
    <p>Only Java program elements with the specified visibility are checked by the javadoc
    clean-up engine. For example, if the &quot;private&quot; box is left unchecked, then
    private methods (or fields or types) are not checked by the engine.</p>
    <h3>Add @values tag (requires javadoc 1.4 or later)</h3>
      <p>The user can select whether to insert a @value tag into the javadoc
      comment of final static fields. Final static fields have a fixed value.
      This option requires a JSDK1.4 (or later) version of the javadoc tool be
      used to generate the javadoc pages.</p>
    <h3>Valid Javadoc tags</h3>
      <p>The user can enter a list of tags that are valid for field Javadoc.
      Only tags that appear on this list are considered valid. Any other tags
      will be removed by the Javadoc Repair tool. The <b>Add</b> button adds a
      tag and the
      <b>Remove</b> button removes a tag from the list.</p>
    <h2><a name="Methods">Methods</a></h2>
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_javadoc_method.gif"></p>
    <h3>Checked Visibility</h3>
    <p>Only Java program elements with the specified visibility are checked by the javadoc
    clean-up engine. For example, if the &quot;private&quot; box is left unchecked, then
    private methods (or fields or types) are not checked by the engine.</p>
    <h3>Check @param tags</h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @param tags are checked. If this option is selected,
    then the engine will check that there is a @param tag for every parameter and that there
    are no additional @param tags. </p>
    <h3>Check @return tag </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @return tag is checked. If this option is selected,
    then the engine will check that there is a @return tag if, and only if, the method has a
    return type other than void. It will also check that there is some text following the
    @return tag. </p>
    <h3>Check @see tag </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @see tag is checked. If this option is selected, then
    the engine will check that there is a @see tag for every method defined by an implemented
    interface.</p>
    <h3>Allow @see tag to replace full Javadoc </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether comments with a single <code>@see </code>tag
    are allowed, as long as that <code>@see</code> refers to a method with the
    same name and parameter types as the one being described. Note that other
    tags are allowed except for <font face="Courier New" size="2">@param</font>,
    <font face="Courier New" size="2">@return</font>, and <font face="Courier New" size="2">@throws</font>,
    since these may conflict with the method signature given by the <code>@see </code>tag.</p>
    <h3>Allow @see tag in non-Javadoc block comment to replace full Javadoc </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether non-Javadoc block comments (&quot;/* ...
    */&quot;) with a single <code>@see </code>tag are
    allowed.</p>
    <h3>Check @throws tags </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @throws tags are checked. If this option is selected,
    then the engine will check that there is a @throws tag for every checked exception that is
    thrown by the method. </p>
    <h3>Allow @throws tags for unchecked exceptions </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether @throws tags are allowed to be included for exceptions that
    are not explicitly declared for the method. The typical case is a desire to document some
    unchecked exceptions that can be thrown, hence the name of the option. </p>
    <h3>Replace @exception tags with @throws tags </h3>
      <p>The user can choose to replace existing @exception tags, which are
      deprecated, with equivalent @throws tags.</p>
      <h3>Required special tag</h3>
      The user can enter the name of a special tag that must be present
          for Javadoc checking to occur.
    <h3>Valid Javadoc tags</h3>
      <p>The user can enter a list of tags that are valid for method Javadoc.
      Only tags that appear on this list are considered valid. Any other tags
      will be removed by the Javadoc Repair tool. The <b>Add</b> button adds a
      tag and the
      <b>Remove</b> button removes a tag from the list.</p>
    <h2><a name="Types">Types</a></h2>
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_javadoc_type.gif"></p>
    <h3>Checked Visibility</h3>
    <p>Only Java program elements with the specified visibility are checked by the javadoc
    clean-up engine. For example, if the &quot;private&quot; box is left unchecked, then
    private methods (or fields or types) are not checked by the engine.</p>
    <h3>Check @author tag </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @author tags are checked. If this option is selected,
    then the engine will check that there is an @author tag for every type (or 
	only for top-level types). If the @author tag
    is missing, it will be added based on the contents of the @author template
    (see the Java &gt; Editor &gt; Templaes &gt; @author preference).
    <h3>Check @version tag </h3>
    <p>The user can select whether the @version tags are checked. If this option is selected,
    then the engine will check that there is an @version tag for every type (or 
	only for top-level types). If the
    @version tag
    is missing, it will be added based on the contents of the &quot;Version
    Identifier&quot; field.
    <h3>Valid Javadoc tags</h3>
      <p>The user can enter a list of tags that are valid for type Javadoc. Only
      tags that appear on this list are considered valid. Any other tags will be
      removed by the Javadoc Repair tool. The <b>Add</b> button adds a tag and the
      <b>Remove</b> button removes a tag from the list.</p>
    <h2><a name="Tags">Tags</a></h2>
    <p><img border="0" src="../images/preferences_javadoc_tags.gif">
    <h3>Custom tags</h3>
      <p>The user can enter a list of custom tags that will be placed at the end
      of the tag list and sorted in the order specified. This applies to field,
      method and type Javadoc. The <b>Add</b> button adds a new tag; the <b>Edit</b>
      button edits an existing tag in the list; the <b>Up</b> button moves a tag
      up in the list; the <b>Down</b> button moves a tag down in the list; and the
      <b>Remove</b> button removes a tag from the list. </td>

    <p>The &quot;Add Export Operation&quot; wizard pages for the &quot;App Client JAR
    file&quot; operation are identical to those one would find in the standard export
    wizard if one were starting a App Client JAR file export manually. The only difference is
    that the &quot;Finish&quot; button is used to save the export operation rather than
    execute it immediately.<p>An <a href="../ant/ExportAppClientToJarFile.html">
    codepro.exportAppClientToJarFile</a> Ant task is used to record the options chosen 
    and perform the operation as part of an Export Set.</td>

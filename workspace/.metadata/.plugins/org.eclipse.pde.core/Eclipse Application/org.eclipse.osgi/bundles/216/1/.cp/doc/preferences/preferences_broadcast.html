      <p>This page is used to control broadcast-related options.</p>
      <h3>Automatically broadcast commit message to</h3>
      <p>This option specifies whether and to whom to send an automatically
      generated message describing the commits you make. Use the Change button
      to select the user(s) and group(s) that should be the recipients of the
      commit messages. The message will look like this:
      <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt>Subject: <b>Commit involving project MyProject</b></dt>
          <blockquote>
            <dt><b>The following were committed</b></dt>
            <dt><b>/MyProject/src/main/Main2.java</b></dt>
            <dt><b>/MyProject/src/main/Main3.java</b></dt>
          </blockquote>
      <p>Only commits involving files trigger this mechanism, so for example
      committing a new empty folder does not produce a message.</p>
      <h3>Subject line prefix</h3>
      <p>This option specifies the subject line prefix used in constructing the
      message subject. The project names involved in the commit will be appended
      after the prefix.</p>
      <h3>Delay (in minutes)</h3>
      <p>This option specifies the delay in minutes between the last commit and
      the message broadcast. If you are performing multiple commits in sequence,
      this provides a way to batch all the changes into a single message rather
      than a message for each individual commit. The default is five minutes.</p>
      <h3>Modified prefix</h3>
      <p>This option determines the label prefix used to trigger the commit
      message. It defaults to the the right angle bracket (&quot;&gt;&quot;)
      which is the character used by the CVS label decorators to indicate a file
      that has been modified but not yet checked in. The change in that prefix
      (it is removed when the file is checked in) triggers the commit message
      broadcast.</td>

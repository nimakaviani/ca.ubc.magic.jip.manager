    <p>The Java Field Wizard allows you to add a field (with optional accessors) to a type.
    The field will be added to the primary type in the currently active compilation unit. </p>
    <p><img src="../../images/field_wizard_results.gif" width="294" height="337"></p>
    <p>New fields can be created via the standard New wizard by selecting the &quot;Java&quot;
    category, or via the popup &quot;New&quot; menu or the <img
    src="../../images/new_field_wiz.gif" width="16" height="16"> icon on the main toolbar.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/java_new_wizard.gif" width="500" height="500"> <img

    <p>The Java Field Wizard contains the following steps: <ol>
      <li><a href="#DefineField">Define Field</a> -- specify all of the details about the field to
        be created. </li>
      <li><a href="#CreateFieldAccessors">Create Field Accessors</a> -- specify which, if any,
        accessors should be created for the field once it has been created. </li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a name="DefineField">Define Field</a></h1>
    <p>This page of the Java Field Wizard allows you to specify all of the details about the
    field to be created.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/field_wizard.gif" width="627" height="521"></p>
    <h3>Enclosing Type</h3>
    <p>The enclosing type field allows you to specify the type to be extended. You must supply
    a fully qualified type name. If a type is currently being edited, this field will be
    pre-populated with the name of that type. You can also click on the button labeled
    &quot;Browse...&quot; to open a Select Type Dialog from which you can select any object
    type.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/method_wizard_select_type.gif" width="296" height="469"></p>
    <h3>Field name</h3>
    <p>The field name field allows you to enter the name of the field to be created. You must
    supply a name that is a valid Java identifier. </p>
    <h3>Field type</h3>
    <p>The field type field allows you to specify the type of the field. The type can be any
    of the primitive types or any object type. </p>
    <p>You can enter the name of the type directly, or you can select the type. All of the
    primitive types are available on the drop-down list. You can also click on the button
    labeled &quot;Browse...&quot; to open a Select Type Dialog from which you can select any
    object type. </p>
    <p>To enter a type that is an array type, select the check box labeled &quot;Array&quot;.
    This will cause the type entered in the field type field to be the base type for the array
    type. You can specify the number of dimensions in the array by entering a positive integer
    into the field labeled &quot;Dimensions&quot;. </p>
    <h3>Initial value</h3>
    <p>The initial value field can be used to enter the expression that will be used to
    initialize the field. If you do not want the field to be initialized, simply leave this
    field blank. </p>
    <h3>Access Modifiers</h3>
    <p>The access modifiers group allows you to specify the visibility of the field. You must
    choose one of the four possible modifiers (&quot;none&quot; implies package visibility). </p>
    <h3>Other Modifiers</h3>
    <p>The other modifiers group allows you to specify any additional modifiers for the field.
    </p>
    <h3>Comment</h3>
    <p>The comment field allows you to enter a descriptive comment for the field. This comment
    will be included as a Javadoc comment when the field is created. It should <b>not</b>
    include the Javadoc comment delimiters. The comment will automatically be formatted and
    surrounded by comment delimiters for you.</p>
    <h1><a name="CreateFieldAccessors">Create Field Accessors</a></h1>
    <p>This page of the Java Field Wizard allows you to specify which, if any, accessors
    should be created for the field once it has been created.. </p>
    <p><img src="../../images/field_wizard_accessors.gif" width="627" height="527"></p>
    <h3>Create getter</h3>
    <p>The create getter check box allows you to control whether a getter method will be
    created for the field. If this check box is selected, the controls within the Getter group
    box can be used to select the visibility of the method. You can also specify whether @see
    tags should be generated.</p>
    <p>The name of the getter method is computed by taking the name of the field, after it has
    been processed as described below, replacing the first character by its uppercase
    equivalent, and prefixing it with the word &quot;get&quot;. </p>
    <h3>Create setter</h3>
    <p>The create setter check box allows you to control whether a setter method will be
    created for the field. If this check box is selected, the controls within the Setter group
    box can be used to select the visibility of the method. You can also specify whether @see
    tags should be generated and what the parameter name should be.</p>
    <p>The name of the setter method is computed by taking the name of the field, after it has
    been processed as described below, replacing the first character by its uppercase
    equivalent, and prefixing it with the word &quot;set&quot;. </p>
    <h3>Parameter name</h3>
    <p>The name of the parameter is initially computed just like the name of the setter
    method, except without capitalizing the first letter and adding the prefix of
    &quot;set&quot;. The parameter name field allows you to override this default name. </p>
    <h3>Remove prefix from field names</h3>
    <p>The remove prefix from field names check box allows you to control how the name of the
    method will be derived from the name of the field. If this check box is selected, the
    longest matching prefix in the list below will be removed from the field name before it is
    used to build the method names. If this check box is not selected, none of the leading
    characters will be removed.</p>
    <h3>Prefix list</h3>
    <p>This field contains a comma-separated list of the prefixes that should be looked for
    and removed.</p>
    <h3>Remove suffix from field names</h3>
    <p>The remove suffix from field names check box also allows you to control how the name of
    the method will be derived from the name of the field. If this check box is selected, the
    longest matching suffix in the list below will be removed from the field name before it is
    used to build the method names. If this check box is not selected, none of the leading
    characters will be removed.</p>
    <h3>Suffix list</h3>
    <p>This field contains a comma-separated list of the suffixes that should be looked for
    and removed.
    <h3>Setter argument prefix</h3>
    <p>This field contains an optional prefix that will be added to create the
    name of the setter argument.
    <h3>Setter argument suffix</h3>
    <p>This field contains an optional suffix that will be added to create the
    name of the setter argument.</td>

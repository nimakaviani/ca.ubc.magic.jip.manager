    <p>A task can be scheduled to start:<ul>
      <li>at a particular time on a particular date, </li>
      <li>at Start Up when Application Developer/Eclipse is first started,</li>
      <li>at Shut Down when Application Developer/Eclipse is exited,</li>
      <li>after any other arbitrary task,</li>
      <li>before a selected class is launched,</li>
      <li>only when triggered manually</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A task can be scheduled to repeat after a specified number of days, hours, and/or
    minutes have elapsed since the last time that the task was started.&nbsp; The minimum
    number of minutes between repetitions is 5 minutes. Optionally, the scheduler can prompt
    the user before a task is run.&nbsp; The prompter can be configured to only appear for a
    specified number of seconds and if no response, then either automatically run the task or
    not.</p>

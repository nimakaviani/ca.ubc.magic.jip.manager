      Configuration</font></b></h1>
      <p>The measurement of code coverage is supported through the addition of a
      new kind of launch configuration called a &quot;Code Coverage&quot;
      configuration. There are two ways of creating a code coverage
      configuration automatically and manually.</p>
      <p>A launch configuration will be automatically created for a class
      (if one does not already exist) when you select &quot;<a href="code_coverage.html">Run Code
      Coverage</a>&quot; from the &quot;CodePro Tools&quot; submenu.</p>
      <p>To manually create a new launch configuration, select
      &quot;Run...&quot; from the &quot;Run&quot; menu to open the launch
      configuration dialog. Select &quot;Code Coverage&quot; in the list of
      configurations. Select &quot;New&quot; to create a new configuration.</p>
      <p>Once you have a code coverage configuration defined for a given class,
      you can use that configuration to control the set of classes for which
      coverage information will be gathered. This is done by opening the launch
      configuration dialog, selecting the configuration for the main class, and
      switching to the &quot;Filters&quot; page. The &quot;Filters&quot; page
      contains two lists of patterns the inclusion list and the exclusion list.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/code_coverage_launch_configuration_filters.gif" width="758" height="531"></p>
      <p>The patterns are simple patterns using the standard pattern matching
      characters &quot;*&quot; matches zero or more characters, &quot;$&quot;
      matches a single character. They are simple in the sense that they only
      match strings, not structures. For example, the pattern</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>junit.*</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>will match any class name beginning with &quot;junit.&quot;, whether or
      not it contains other periods. This means, for example, that the pattern
      will match the class</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>junit.framework.TestCase</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Similarly, the pattern</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>*Test</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>will match any class whose name ends in &quot;Test&quot; whether the
      class is defined in your code or in code supplied by a third party.</p>
      <p>The inclusion list specifies which classes could have coverage
      information recorded for them. If the list is empty, all classes are
      eligible. If the list contains one or more patterns, only those classes
      whose fully qualified name matches at least one pattern are eligible.</p>
      <p>The exclusion list specifies which of the eligible classes will not
      have coverage information recorded for them. A class will be excluded if
      it matches one or more of the patterns in the list. If the list is empty,
      then coverage information will be recorded for all of the eligible
      classes.</p>
      <p>The code coverage configuration can also be used to cause a code
      coverage report to be generated immediately after the measurements are
      recorded. Reports can be generated in three different formats <a href="code_coverage_sample_report.html">HTML</a>, text,
      and XML. You can also specify that you want the report to be opened
      (within Eclipse, if possible) after it has been generated.</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/code_coverage_launch_configuration_reports.gif" width="758" height="531"></p>
      <p>It is not necessary to generate a report at the time the information is
      recorded because you can generate a report at any time from the <b><a href="code_coverage_view.html"> Coverage
      View</a></b>.

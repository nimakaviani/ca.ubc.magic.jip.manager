    <td><h1><font face="Verdana" color="#CC0000"><b>Collaboration Groups View</b></font>
      </h1>
      <p>This view is for adding, modifying, and deleting groups from the
      collaboration server. It is part of the <b>Collaboration Administration</b>
      perspective.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/groups_view.gif" width="443" height="162"></p>
      <p>A group essentially consists of users and other groups. A group may or
      may not be public. A public group is visible to everyone; that is, it is
      included in every list of groups displayed for selection. In contrast, a
      non-public group is only visible if the current user is a member of the
      group (or is the administrator).</p>
      <p>A group also may have zero or more leaders. A leader has special
      privileges with respect to the group, such as the ability to add and
      remove members. A leader need not be a member of the group.</p>
      <p>Only the administrator may add and delete groups unless the <a href="server.html">server</a>
      allows open enrollment, in which case anyone may add a group, and group
      leaders may delete the groups they lead. In any case, group leaders may
      modify a group.</p>
      <h3>Tool Bar</h3>
      <p>The tool bar has the following buttons</p>
      <ul>
        <li><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/group-add.gif" width="19" height="17">
          Add a group using the group wizard (described below).</li>
        <li><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/delete.gif" width="16" height="16">
          Delete the selected groups.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tool bar menu contains the following items</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refresh this view from the collaboration server.
          (The view does not update automatically in response to changes on the
          server.)</li>
        <li><b>Import Groups</b> - Add groups described in an XML file produced
          by the Export Groups item.</li>
        <li><b>Export Groups</b> - Export the groups to an XML file suitable for
          use by the Import Groups item.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Group List</h3>
      <p>The columns in this list show the group name, identifier and number of
      members. If it is open, the properties view shows additional information
      about the selected group, such as the leaders.</p>
      <p>The context menu contains the following items</p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
        <tr>

                below).</li>
              <li><b>Edit</b> - Edit the selected group.</li>

      <h3><a name="GroupWizard">Group Wizard</a></h3>
      <p>The group wizard is for adding or editing a user.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/new_group_wizard.gif" width="438" height="405"></p>
      <p>The <b>name</b> is used for display purposes. It must be unique.</p>
      <p>The <b>identifier</b> is used internally to identify a group. It must
      be unique, and is typically some portion of the group name.</p>
      <p>The <b>Everyone</b> radio button makes the group visible to everyone
      (in other words, public). The Only <b>Members</b> radio button makes the
      group visible only to group members (in other words, non-public).</p>

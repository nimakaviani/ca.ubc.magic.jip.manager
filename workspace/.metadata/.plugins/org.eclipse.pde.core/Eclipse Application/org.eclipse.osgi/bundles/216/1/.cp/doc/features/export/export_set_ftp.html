    <p>The &quot;Add Export Operation&quot; wizard pages for the &quot;FTP&quot; operation
    are identical to those one would find in the standard export wizard if one were
    starting a FTP export manually. The only difference is that the &quot;Finish&quot; button
    is used to save the export operation rather than execute it immediately.</p>

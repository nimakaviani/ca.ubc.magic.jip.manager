    <p>Migrating from one IDE version to another is inconvenient due to the
    difficulty in moving general workspace preferences from one version to another. Likewise,
    configuring multiple user's workspaces with common settings (such as code formatting
    preference, classpath variable settings, etc.) is also very difficult.</p>
    <p>CodePro makes it easy for users to copy workspace preferences in any granularity
    between multiple workspaces. It also makes it easy for team leaders and administrators to
    set up common sets of preferences for configuring multiple workspaces.</p>
      <p>Key advantages relative to the simple preference import/export
      mechanism in base Eclipse are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Much better control over the granularity of exported preferences.
          This makes it easy, for example, to share just your code formatter
          preferences with other team members without forcing them to take the
          rest of your preferences as well.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Better handling of many preferences like classpath variables. The
          Eclipse preference exporter exports classpath variables using hard coded
          paths which makes them pretty useless when imported into another
          workspace or on another machine. The CPS preference exporter will
          export them in a workspace-relative format that makes them useable in
          multiple workspaces and on multiple developer machines.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Support for many non-standard preference settings like templates and
          working sets. These are stored as XML files in your workspace metadata
          directory and are not visible to the Eclipse preference exporter.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Importing preferences</h3>
    <p>To import preferences, open the Import Wizard, select &quot;Preferences&quot; and click
    &quot;Next&quot;. At the top of the wizard page, is an area for selecting the location
    from which the preference file should be imported.</p>
    <p>The first option, &quot;File
    System&quot; allows the user to import the preferences from any arbitrary location in the
    file system. It defaults to \preferences\preferences.pref (the &quot;.pref&quot; suffix is
    used for all preference files). The wizard automatically remembers the names of the last
    eight files that have been imported.</p>
    <p>The second option, &quot;Project&quot;, allows the
    user to load preferences from a project loaded in their workspace. The wizard
    automatically remembers the last project imported to as well as the last eight files that
    have been imported.</p>
    <p><a name="Server"></a>The third option, &quot;Server&quot;, can be used
    only if a <a href="../collaboration/server.html">collaboration server</a>
    has been specified in the <a href="../../preferences/preferences_collaboration.html">preferences</a>.
    This option allows the user to load preferences from the <a href="../collaboration/server.html">collaboration
    server</a>. The wizard automatically remembers the last path used.</p>
	<p><a name="URL"></a>The fourth option, &quot;URL&quot;, can be used to load 
	preferences from a preference file stored at a web location accessible via a 
	standard URL.</p>

    <p>Once a preference file has been selected, the checkbox tree shows a list of all
    preferences <a href="export_prefs.html">recorded</a> within the file. Each plugin that
    defines any preferences recorded to the file is listed and may be individually selected.
    Some plugins define multiple categories of preferences (e.g., the &quot;Java Core&quot;
    plugin defines both &quot;Classpath Variables&quot; and &quot;Code Formatting&quot;
    preferences) which also may be individually selected. Immediately above the checkbox tree
    is a dropdown list providing quick access to common sets of preferences such as &quot;Java
    Classpath Variables&quot; or &quot;Java Code Formatting&quot;. Only preferences recorded
    to the file are listed. Selecting one of those items will cause the appropriate checkboxes
    to be checked.</p>

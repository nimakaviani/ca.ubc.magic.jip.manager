    <p>This group contains metrics that measure the complexity of the code.</p>
    <h3>Average Block Depth</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This audit rule finds methods and constructors that have too many
      levels of nested blocks. A method with too many levels of nested blocks
      can be difficult to understand.</p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>
      <p><img src="../../images/metrics/metric_avg_block_depth.gif" width="364" height="73"></p>
      <h4>Parameters</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Include try statements </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether try/catch/finally blocks are counted when
          determining block depth. </dd>
        <dt>Include synchronized statements </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether synchronized blocks are counted when
          determining block depth. </dd>
        <dt>Maximum average value </dt>
        <dd>Causes the metric to flag any projects, packages or types with too
          great an average block depth. </dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <h3> Average Cyclomatic Complexity</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the average of the cyclomatic complexity of each of the methods 
		defined in the target elements. The cyclomatic complexity of a single 
		method is a measure of the number of distinct paths of execution within 
		the method. It is measured by adding the one path for the method with 
		each of the paths created by conditional statements (such as &quot;if&quot; and 
		&quot;for&quot;) and operators (such as ?:).. </p>
      <h4>Applicability</h4>
      <p>This metric can be computed for any method or method container. </p>

      <h4>Parameters</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Include instance fields in computation of complexity </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether instance fields are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Include instance fields without initializers in computation of complexity </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether instance fields without initializers are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Include instance initializers in computation of complexity </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether instance initializers are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Include catch clauses in computation of complexity </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether catch clauses are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Include uses of conditional operator (?:) </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether uses of the conditional operator are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Include uses of conditional-and (&amp;) and conditional-or (||)
          operators </dt>
        <dd>Determines whether uses of the conditional-and and conditional-or
          are counted. </dd>
        <dt>Maximum average value </dt>
        <dd>Causes the metric to flag any projects, packages or types with too
          much complexity per method. </dd>

    <h3> Weigthed Methods</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the sum of the cyclomatic complexity of each of the methods

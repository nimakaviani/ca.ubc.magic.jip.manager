		<a href="code_coverage.html">Code Coverage</a> property sheet as shown 
		above. This property sheet contains a check box labeled
          &quot;Instrument for code coverage&quot; that allows you to control
          whether the class files within the project are to be instrumented. </p>
		<p>
          The property sheet also allows you to control which class files are
          instrumented. This is done through the use of two lists of patterns:
          the inclusion list and the exclusion list.
          </p><p>
          The patterns are simple patterns using the standard pattern matching
          characters: &quot;*&quot; matches zero or more characters, &quot;$&quot;
          matches a single character. They are simple in the sense that they
          only match strings, not structures. For example, the pattern</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>junit.*</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>will match any class name beginning with &quot;junit.&quot;,
          whether or not it contains other periods. This means, for example,
          that the pattern will match the class</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>junit.framework.TestCase</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Similarly, the pattern</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>*Test</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>will match any class whose name ends in &quot;Test&quot; whether
          the class is defined in your code or in code supplied by a third party.
          </p><p>
          The inclusion list specifies which classes could be instrumented
          (that is, have coverage information recorded for them. If the list is
          empty, all classes are eligible. If the list contains one or more
          patterns, only those classes whose fully qualified name matches at
          least one pattern are eligible
          </p><p>
          The exclusion list specifies which of the eligible classes will not
          be instrumented. A class will be excluded if it matches one or more
          of the patterns in the list. If the list is empty, then all of the
          eligible classes will be instrumented.

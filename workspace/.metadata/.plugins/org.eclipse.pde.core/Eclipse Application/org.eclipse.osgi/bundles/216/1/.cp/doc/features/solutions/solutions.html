    <p class="MsoNormal">Our use of the word &quot;Solutions&quot; comes from its use in 
    IBM's Visual Age for Java where solutions are projects that &quot;logically&quot; 
    contain other projects.&nbsp; Rather than loading and updating projects 
    individually, solutions and the projects and nested solutions that they 
    contain can be <a href="solutions_actions.html">loaded and updated</a> as a single unit.</p>

    <img border="1" src="../../images/solutions/solution_graph.gif" align="left" hspace="10" width="445" height="147"></a>Solutions 
    are projects just like any other and can contain java code or another other 
    type of resources.&nbsp; In addition, solutions can be &quot;nested&quot; so that when 
    the parent solution is loaded or updated, all projects and nested solutions 
    are recursively loaded or updated.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Only <font color="#FF0000"><b>shared projects </b>
    </font>(projects and solutions already stored in a repository) can be 
    contained by a solution.&nbsp; Projects that are not shared can <b>not</b> 
    be added to a solution.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">New solutions can be created using the
    <a href="solutions_wizard.html">New Solution wizard</a>, while existing 
    projects can be converted into solutions using the

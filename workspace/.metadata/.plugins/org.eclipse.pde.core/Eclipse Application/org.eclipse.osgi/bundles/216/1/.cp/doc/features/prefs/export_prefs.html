    <p>Migrating from one IDE version to another is inconvenient due to the
    difficulty in moving general workspace preferences from one version to another. Likewise,
    configuring multiple user's workspaces with common settings (such as code formatting
    preference, classpath variable settings, etc.) is also very difficult.</p>
    <p>CodePro makes it easy for users to copy workspace preferences in any granularity
    between multiple workspaces. It also makes it easy for team leaders and administrators to
    set up common sets of preferences for configuring multiple workspaces.</p>
      <p>Key advantages relative to the simple preference import/export
      mechanism in base Eclipse are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Much better control over the granularity of exported preferences.
          This makes it easy, for example, to share just your code formatter
          preferences with other team members without forcing them to take the
          rest of your preferences as well.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Better handling of many preferences like classpath variables. The
          Eclipse preference exporter exports classpath variables using hard coded
          paths which makes them pretty useless when imported into another
          workspace or on another machine. The CPS preference exporter will
          export them in a workspace-relative format that makes them useable in
          multiple workspaces and on multiple developer machines.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Support for many non-standard preference settings like templates and
          working sets. These are stored as XML files in your workspace metadata
          directory and are not visible to the Eclipse preference exporter.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Exporting preferences</h3>
    <p>To export preferences, open the Export Wizard, select &quot;Preferences&quot; and click
    &quot;Next&quot;. At the top of the wizard is a checkbox tree list showing all of the
    preferences that may be exported. Each plugin that defines any preferences is listed and
    may be individually selected. Some plugins define multiple categories of preferences
    (e.g., the &quot;Java Core&quot; plugin defines both &quot;Classpath Variables&quot; and
    &quot;Code Formatting&quot; preferences) which also may be individually selected.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/export_prefs_wizard2.gif" width="470" height="573"></p>
    <p>Immediately above the checkbox tree is a dropdown list providing quick access to common
    sets of preferences such as &quot;Java Classpath Variables&quot; or &quot;Java Code
    Formatting&quot;. Selecting one of those items will cause the appropriate checkboxes to be
    checked. Below the the checkbox tree are two checkboxes controlling some additional export
    options. The &quot;Include optional settings&quot; checkbox includes some optional
    categories into the list of available preferences (these tend to be very workspace
    specific and most appropriate for a single user wishing to move from one release of
    Application Developer or Eclipse to another). The &quot;Show all plugins&quot; checkbox shows all loaded plugins
    including those that do not define any exportable preferences.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/export_prefs_wizard3.gif" width="470" height="573"></p>
    <p>At the bottom of the wizard page, is an area for selecting the location to which the
    preference file should be exported. The first option, &quot;File System&quot; allows the
    user to export the preferences to any arbitrary location in the file system. It defaults
    to \preferences\preferences.pref (the &quot;.pref&quot; suffix is used for all preference
    files). The wizard automatically remembers the names of the last eight files that have
    been exported.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/export_prefs_target1.gif" width="446" height="87"></p>
    <p>The second option, &quot;Project&quot;, allows the user to store the preferences to a
    project loaded in their workspace. This makes it easy to put the preference file under
    some form of source code control such as CVS, PVCS or ClearCase. The wizard automatically
    remembers the last project exported to as well as the last eight files that have been
    exported.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/export_prefs_target2.gif" width="446" height="85"></p>
      <p>The third option, &quot;Server&quot;, can be used only if a <a href="../collaboration/server.html">collaboration
      server</a> has been specified in the <a href="../../preferences/preferences_collaboration.html">preferences</a>.
      It allows the user to store the preferences on the <a href="../collaboration/server.html">collaboration
      server</a>. The wizard automatically remembers the last path used.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/export_prefs_target3.gif" width="445" height="85"></p>
      <p><a name="GlobalPrefs"></a>The fourth option, &quot;User&quot;, likewise
      can be used only if a <a href="../collaboration/server.html">collaboration
      server</a> has been specified in the <a href="../../preferences/preferences_collaboration.html">preferences</a>.
      It allows the user to send preferences to other users as an attachment to
      a <a href="../collaboration/messages_view.html">message</a>; the
      attachment will be automatically applied upon receipt without intervention
      by the receiving user. Thus, this option provides a way to silently set
      preferences in the workbenches of other users. This can only be done for <a href="../collaboration/users_view.html">users</a>
      and <a href="../collaboration/groups_view.html">groups</a> led by the
      user, unless the user is the administrator, in which case it can be done
      for any user or group. The wizard automatically remembers the last
      users/groups used.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/export_prefs_target4.gif" width="446" height="88"></p>
    <p>Preference files are stored in standard XML format. The following is an example of what
    an exported preference file looks like. In this case, only the users classpath variables
    have been exported. Note that the classpath variables are stored relative to the
    &quot;eclipse.root&quot;, &quot;eclipse.workspace&quot; or &quot;eclipse.drive&quot; as
    appropriate (system classpath variables such as &quot;JRE_LIB&quot; are not exported).
    This makes it easy to import these preferences into another workspace that might be
    installed on a different drive or in a different location relative to the original
    workspace.</p>

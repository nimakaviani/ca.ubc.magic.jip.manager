    <p>The <b>History</b> section of the code coverage preference page allows you to specify
    how many versions of each <a href="../features/codecoverage/code_coverage.html"> code coverage</a> report should be maintained.</p>
    
      <!-- p>The <b><a name="Appearance">Appearance</a></b> preference page allows you to control the
      appearance of the <b><a href="../features/codecoverage/code_coverage_view.html">Coverage View</a></b>.</p -->
      
      <p>The <b>Labels</b> section allows you to control what information is
      displayed in the labels for the elements in the contents region. You can
      optionally include two pieces of information the delta between the
      earliest and latest reports for the code, and the number of lines of code
      that were not covered.</p>
      
      <p>The <b>Threshold</b> section allows you to control whether results that
      are lower than some threshold are highlighted within the content region,
      and if so what that threshold should be and the color used to highlight
      those elements.</p>
      
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_code_coverage_data_locations.gif"></p>
    <p>The <b>Data Locations</b> preference page allows you to specify additional locations
    in which CodePro should look for code coverage reports after the coverage engine runs.
    This can be useful when the code under test is running on a separate machine.

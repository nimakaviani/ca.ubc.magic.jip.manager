    <p>The CodePro Modified Type view tracks all modifications or additions made to
    various types within the workspace. The types may be deleted or sorted by name, package,
    time of modification or type of modification (e.g., added or modified). Selecting a type
    in the list will open an editor and focus it on the code for the type.</p>
    <p>Options are provided via a <a href="../preferences/preferences_history.html">preference
    page</a> to show only the most recent <em>n</em> number of types and/or only those types
    modified in the specified time period (e.g., the last week, the last <em>n</em> days,
    etc.).<h3>Early Startup</h3>
    <p>In order that CodePro track modified types, this plugin must be
    <a href="early_startup.html">loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched</a>.</td>

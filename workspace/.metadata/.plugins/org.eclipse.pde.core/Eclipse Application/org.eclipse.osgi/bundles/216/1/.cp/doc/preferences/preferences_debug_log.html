      <p>This page gives you easy access to the Eclipse log file. The file may
    be viewed or cleared. You can also specify which program should be used to view the log
    file and which program should be used to explore directories. Shortcuts for
      viewing and clearing the Eclipse log file are provided on the <a href="../codepro_menu.html">CodePro
      menu</a>. Convenience options are provided for turning on and off various 
		CodePro tracing options.<p>To turn on CodePro tracing options, check the 
    desired tracing options, then restart Eclipse <br>
    with the &quot;-debug&quot; and &quot;-consoleLog&quot; command line options, as in:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    C:\\eclipse\eclipse.exe -debug -consolelog<p>Trace options from other 
    eclipse plugins can be merged into the .options file located in the 
    &quot;eclipse&quot; directory.<p>You can obtain a thread dump by switching to the open 
    console window and pressing ctrl-break.</td>

      		<p>The <b> Coverage View</b> is divided into two sections a content region and a
      details region. The content region displays the Java elements for which
      coverage information was recorded. These elements can either be displayed
      in a hierarchy (like that shown in either the Package Explorer or the
      Outline View), or as a flat list of elements of a similar kind.</p>

            <td width="0"></td>
            <td valign="top">Selecting an element in the content region will
              cause the details region to reflect the information recorded about
              that element. The details region contains two tabbed pages the <b>
              Details</b> page and the <b> History</b> page.
              <p>The <b> Details</b> page shows the coverage information reported for
              classes, methods, lines, blocks, and instructions. (Class
              information is not available when the selected element is a
              method.) The information is expressed both as a fraction (the
              number of covered units divided by the total number of units) and
              as a percentage. The percentage is also represented graphically. <a href="../../preferences/preferences_code_coverage.html">Preferences</a>
              are available to control the colors of the graphic bars and
              whether percentage changes are shown in the tree view. If the
              coverage for an item falls below a user <a href="../../preferences/preferences_code_coverage.html">established
              percentage</a>, that item is highlighted in red (or any other <a href="../../preferences/preferences_code_coverage.html">chosen
              color</a>).</p>
              <p>The meaning of some of these units should be explained. Classes
              refers to individual classes, not compilation units. Methods
              should be self-explanatory. Lines correspond to lines of code
              within the source. Instructions are individual bytecodes executed
              by the VM. Blocks are groups of instructions that do not include
              any branches.</p>
              <p>The <b> History</b> page displays a line graph showing the changes in
              the coverage information for the selected element across all of
              the available versions of the report. You can use this page to
              determine whether the results are generally getting better as well
              as to identify whether a particular change to a test increased the
              coverage. <a href="../../preferences/preferences_code_coverage.html">Preferences</a>
              are available to control the number of historical versions kept
              for each report.<br>

				ruler, covered lines will show one to three bars depending on he

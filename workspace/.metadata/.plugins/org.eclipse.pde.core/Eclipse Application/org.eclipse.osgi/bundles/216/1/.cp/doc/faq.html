<h3><a name="installer_error">What should I do if I'm getting errors running the installer or the installer hangs?</a></h3>
<p>1. If you're using Java 1.3, our installer currently does not support Java&nbsp;1.3. You may use the <b>-vm</b> command line argument to specify a different JVM to be used by the installer.</p>
<p>Example:<code>  Product_v1.0.1_win32_x86.exe -vm "C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.5.0_05\jre\bin\java.exe"</code></p>
<p>2. In cases where the installer can not find your TEMP or TMP environment
variable, you can also specify a different Temp directory by adding the
<b>-tmp</b> option. You have to create the c:\mytemp folder first before running the installer.</p>
<p>Example: <code> Product_v1.0.1_win32_x86.exe -tmp c:\Temp</code></p>
<p>3. In some cases where the splash screen won't come up, run the installer with the <b>-nosplash </b>option.</p>
<p>Example: <code> Product_v1.0.1_win32_x86.exe -nosplash</code></p>
<p>4. If none of the above help, run the installer with <b>-out</b> option to generate a log file. 
This will run the installer in verbose mode and redirect output to&nbsp;the file&nbsp;<code>installer.log</code>
in the&nbsp;directory where the&nbsp;installer is located.
Examine the log file to determine the cause or&nbsp;send the log file to support and we'll take a look.</p>
<p>Example: <code>Product_v1.0.1_win32_x86.exe -out installer.log --verbose</code></p>
<h3><a name="VersionSupported">What version of Application Developer/Eclipse does CodePro/EclipsePro support?</a></h3>
<p>Officially, CodePro supports WebSphere Application Developer 5.1, Rational Application
      Developer 6.0 &amp; 7.0 and the Eclipse
      2.1, 3.0,&nbsp;3.1, 3.2 &amp; 3.3 code streams. See
    the <a href="requirements.html">System Requirements</a>
page for full details. EclipsePro only supports Eclipse and not
Application Developer. CodePro AnalytiX Rational Edition only supports
Rational Application Developer and Software Architect.</p>
<h3><a name="EclipseSupport">Does CodePro/EclipsePro support on-going Eclipse open source updates?</a></h3>
<p>Unofficially,
    CodePro/EclipsePro supports the emerging Eclipse open source code stream in "beta
    test" mode on the most recent "<a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_top">stable</a>"
    build. As new stable builds are released, we will try to get the product updated within a
    few days. We do not plan to support any of the "<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_top">integration</a>"
    or "<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/" target="_top">nightly</a>"
    builds.</p>
    <h3><a name="OSSupport">Which operating systems are supported?</a></h3>
 <p>CodePro runs on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems as well as
    Linux and Macintosh OSX. Other operating systems will be considered as IBM adds support for them to Eclipse.
    &nbsp; See the <a href="requirements.html">System Requirements</a> page for full details.
    Note that the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a> and <a href="features/beaninfo_bridge.html">BeanInfo Bridge</a> features only work under Windows
      as they require VA Java with VA Assist loaded (which is only available under Windows).</p>
      <h3><a name="MemoryOptimization">How can I improve
      Application Developer/Eclipse startup time, reduce swapping and eliminate
      unnecessary garbage collection?</a></h3>
      <p>Begin by specifying the <i>starting</i> amount of memory (-vmargs -Xms###m)
      in your Application Developer/Eclipse startup command line (e.g., the
      target field within a Windows shortcut). If this is <i>not</i> specified,
      Eclipse's starting amount of memory is quite small (only 40 MB). You 
		should also specify the <i>maximum</i> amount of memory that Eclipse can 
		use (-vmargs -Xmx###m) and the maximum amount of perm space available (-vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=###m).
		We typically recommend something like this:</p>
		<code>-vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xms256m	-Xmx512m</code>
			<h3><a name="CodeProOptimization">Can I turn off any CodePro features to improve performance?</a></h3>
			<p>Yes. CodePro has a very large number of
      features, some of which may be turned off to improve overall system
      performance.</p>
      <ul><li><b>History views</b> - CodePro tracks every Java file you access in
          its <a href="features/java_history.html">History</a> view and every
          modified type of method in its <a href="features/modified_types.html">Modified
          Types</a> and <a href="features/modified_members.html">Modified
          Members</a> views. The history data is persisted a across sessions and
          reconstituted on startup. If you don't need this feature, you can save
          a small amount of startup time and file access/modification time by
          unchecking the <b>Track modified elements</b> and <b>Track history</b>
          options on the <a href="preferences/preferences_history.html"><b>CodePro
          | History</b></a> preference page.</li>
          <li><b>Task Scheduler</b> - If you do not have a need to run <a href="features/scheduler/scheduler.html"> scheduled
          tasks</a> at startup, you can uncheck the <b>CodePro - Core UI</b> option
          on the Eclipse <b>Workbench | Startup</b> preference page.</li>
          <li><b>CodePro Splash Screen</b> - You can disable this in two ways by
          either unchecking the <b>CodePro - Splash</b> option on the Eclipse <b>Workbench
          | Startup</b> preference page or by unchecking the <b>Show splash
          screen at startup</b> option on the <b><a href="preferences/preferences_startup.html">CodePro
          | Startup</a></b> preference page.</li>
          <li><b>CodePro Menu</b> - If you don't need quick access to CodePro
          features available from this menu, you can disable it by unchecking
          the <b>Show CodePro menu</b> option on the <b><a href="preferences/preferences_startup.html">CodePro
          | Startup</a></b> preference page.</li>
          <li><b>Dynamic Code Auditing</b> - When dynamic code auditing is
          enabled, any Java file that is open that matches your dynamic audit
          criteria will be automatically audited when it is opened. If you have
          files open at shutdown, they will be automatically audited at startup.
          To disable dynamic code auditing, uncheck the Dynamically audit code
          option on the <b><a href="preferences/preferences_audit.html#DynamicAudit">CodePro
          | Audit | Dynamic</a></b> preference page.</li>
          <li><b>Browser Colors</b> - If you are using any of the CodePro enhanced
          perspectives (e.g., Java+, Java Browsing+ or Resources+), CodePro
          provides options to color highlight resources based on their error
          status, repository change status or their age. You can turn off any or
          all of these options via the <b><a href="preferences/preferences_browsers.html">CodePro
          | Browsers</a></b> preference page.</li></ul>
          <h3><a name="CleanStartup">I just installed CodePro so why don't I see any of the CodePro features?</a></h3>
          <p>Eclipse 3.x and other IDEs based upon Eclipse 
    3.x may not immediately recognize new tools if they are not installed using 
    the Eclipse Install and Update Manager. This occurs because Eclipse 3.x 
    caches plug-in information for a faster startup at the cost of not 
    recognizing changes to the installed plugins. To workaround this problem, 
    include the "-clean" option on the command line used to startup Eclipse. The 
    "-clean" option causes Eclipse to reparse and recache the plug-in 
    information, picking up any newly installed or revised features. Once the 
    plug-in information has been recached and CodePro appears as expected, you 
    can remove the "-clean" option.</p>
      <p><b> An alternative (and often more
      effective choice) to the
      "-clean" option is to clean the Eclipse "configuration" directory as 
		follows. </b>If you are installing into Eclipse 3.0, you should also delete your <b>&lt;Eclipse&gt;/configuration</b>
      directory before re-starting Eclipse (it is recreated at startup). This is to 
	avoid a common Eclipse 3.x plugin cache bug. The Full Installer can do this 
	for you automatically. If you are installing into Eclipse 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, delete 
	everything in the "configuration" directory except the <b>
		config.ini</b> file and the <b>org.eclipse.update/platform.xml</b> file 
		(Eclipse 3.2 and above). You should also keep your <b>org.eclipse.update/bookmarks.xml</b> 
		file (Eclipse 3.1 and above) in order to preserve your update site 
		bookmarks.</p>
      <p>Note that this problem is likely due to <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68097">Eclipse
      Bug #68097</a>. From the Eclipse 3.0 readme file:</p>
      <h4><i>Manually installing features and plug-ins on a FAT file system (Windows only)</i></h4>
      <p><i>When features and plug-ins are manually installed on top of an
      Eclipse-based product install located on a FAT file system that has
      already been run at least once, the product must be explicitly restarted
      with the system property osgi.checkConfiguration set to true. This
      property can be set in the eclipse/configuration/config.ini file, or
      passed to the eclipse command line via the -vmargs option. For example,
      restart with the following command: eclipse.exe -vmargs -Dosgi.checkConfiguration=true.
      Then, open Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Manage Configuration dialog and
      toggle on the "Show disabled features" button its toolbar.
      Select the newly "installed" feature and press on the
      "Enable feature" action on the right pane (or select the action
      from the feature's context menu). (bugs <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=52525">52525</a>,
      <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=66120">66120</a>, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67461">67461</a>).</i></p><h3><a name="warningmsg">I
installed CodePro under Eclipse 3.2 using the zip file for Eclipse 3.2
but when I launch eclipse why do I get a warning message that says: <i>"The
version of CodePro is compiled for Eclipse 3.1 but is currently being
executed in Eclipse 3.2. Please download and install the appropriate
version for this environment."</i></a></h3>
<p>Make sure 
	you don't have an older version of CodePro installed. If you have a linked 
	installation, check the links files to make sure they are pointing to the 
	correct version. If you copied the plugins into the eclipse plugins 
	directory, please install on a fresh copy of Eclipse. Lastly, try clearing 
	your eclipse configuration directory by deleting everything except for the 
	config.ini file.</p><h3><a name="ClearCase">Are there any
    special considerations when using ClearCase?</a></h3><p>Yes. ClearCase
    uses a pessimistic "check-in/check-out" model. Many operations in Eclipse will
    fail unless a type is properly checked out before editing (refactoring, for example). The
    same is true for specific CodePro features such as the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a> and <a href="features/beaninfo_bridge.html">BeanInfo
    Bridge</a>. In order for the "Edit GUI" and "Edit BeanInfo" commands
    to work, make sure that the class that you plan to edit has been properly checked out from
    ClearCase.</p><h3><a name="VCELayout">When I edit my
    GUI using the VCE Bridge, why don't I see my layout?</a></h3><p>VA Java does not
    recreate the VCE layout information from the source of the class. Rather, it stores that
    meta data within the repository. VA Java does provide a source code generation option for
    generating that meta data into a special <strong>getBuilderData()</strong> method. That
    method must be present in any exported class for it to be properly edited using the VA
    Java VCE and, consequently, the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>. Rather
    than forcing you to go back an regenerate all of the source for your GUI classes, VA Assist provides
    a convenient "Generate missing meta data methods on export" option that will
    cause those missing methods to be generated any time a class is exported either to a directory
    or directly to Application Developer/Eclipse.</p><h3><a name="VCECustomComponents">If
      my GUI references any custom components, do those components need to be
      loaded into VA Java before editing the class with the VCE Bridge?</a></h3><p>Yes. Any custom parts or nested components
      need to be present within VA Java. All you need to do is load the VA Java
      project containing the referenced components before invoking the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>.
      One of the basic assumptions of the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>
      is that you are editing GUI classes originally created in VA Java so you
      would have those pieces available already in VA Java. If you load your VA
      Java projects into VA Java, that should solve any dependency problems that
      you might have.
      The VA Java GUI builder only knows about types within its environment.
      If you want to use classes that you have created in Eclipse, you will need
      to import them into the VA Java environment you want to use. The direct
      import from Eclipse option that has been added to the Import
      Wizard by VA Assist
      should make that easy. If you plan to do this frequently, you might want
      to set up an Eclipse
      Import set on the VA Java side and use the Task
      Scheduler to have it run automatically at VA Java startup. That way,
      whenever you invoke the <a href="features/vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>
      it will automatically import your new/changed beans and make them
      available for use.</p><h3><a name="VCEProblems">I
      am having problems getting the VCE Bridge to work; what should I do?</a></h3>Here are some questions to ask yourself and
      some suggestions:
      <ol><li>Do you have VA Assist installed into VA Java. What version of VA 
		Assist are you using? </li><li>Is CodePro configured to talk to your VA Java installation?<br>
          <a href="preferences/preferences_vaassist.html">./preferences/preferences_vaassist.html</a></li><li>Is VA Assist in VAJ configured to know about your Eclipse
          installation?</li></ol>
      <p>Sending us a screen shot of both of the above screens in your
      environment might help us identify the problem. Are any exceptions
      recorded either into the VA Java "ide\program\va-debug.log"
      file, the Eclipse "&lt;workspace&gt;\.metadata\.log" file or the
      "&lt;workspace&gt;\.metadata\.plugins\com.instantiations.assist.eclipse.core\ws-debug.log"
      file? If so, please send us those files. If none are recorded, you can try
      turning on the "log communications" options in both products
      which will cause communication status messages to be recorded to the log
      files which should help us analyze the problem.</p>
      <h3><a name="CPSDebugging">How do I turn on debugging for CodePro Server?</a></h3>
      <p>The CodePro Server Ant tasks for audit, metrics, and dashboard creation will produce debugging output if you include the additional attribute</p>
      <pre><code>debug="true"</code></pre>
      <p>This attribute will cause additional information to be written to the Ant output and will cause several large directories of information to be left on disk for debugging purposes. In particular, the configuration and workspace directories used by Eclipse will not be deleted. 
      Unless otherwise specified, those directories are located in the temporary directory, inside a subdirectory named "instantiations", in a directory whose name is the name of the task for which debugging was enabled and a timestamp of when the directory was created. For example:</p>
      <pre>C:\Temp\instantiations\audit-20090802161035</pre>
      <p>Each such directory will contain, in addition to the configuration and workspace directories, the input and output files for Server. The Ant tasks create an input file (named "audit.xml" in the above example) to communicate with Server and Server produces an output file to communicate results back to the Ant tasks (named "audit.properties" in the above example).</p>
      <p>For debugging purposes, both of these files, the content of the Ant output, and the Eclipse log file (located as usual in "workspace/.metadata/.log") are all useful to us.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Add Export Operation&quot; wizard pages for the &quot;JAR file&quot;
    operation should be identical to those one would find in the standard export wizard if one
    were starting a JAR file export manually. The primary difference is that the
    &quot;Finish&quot; button is used to save the export operation rather than execute it
    immediately.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> to avoid potential <b>OperationCanceledException</b> errors
    during execution, make sure to turn on the &quot;Overwrite existing files
    without warning&quot; option. If that option is turned off and the jar file
    already exists, you will get an exception.</p>

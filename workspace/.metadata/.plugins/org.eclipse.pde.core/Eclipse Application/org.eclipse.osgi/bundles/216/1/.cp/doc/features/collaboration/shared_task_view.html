<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="700">
  <tr>
    <td><h1><font face="Verdana" color="#CC0000"><b>Collaboration Shared Task View</b></font>
      </h1>
      <p>This view is for creating <a href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">scheduled
      tasks</a> and assigning them to users and groups. It is part of the <b>Collaboration Administration</b> perspective.</p>
      <p>A shared (scheduled)
      task automatically appears in the <a href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">scheduler
      view</a> of an assignee's workbench. A shared task may be locked, meaning
      an assignee cannot delete it. The icons associated with shared tasks are
      the same as for scheduled tasks, but with a <img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/shared_dec.gif" width="7" height="8">
      shared decorator, and possibly a <img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/locked_dec.gif" width="7" height="8">
      locked decorator.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/shared_task_view.gif" width="643" height="284"></p>
      <p>Only group leaders and the administrator may assign a shared task to
      users besides themselves. This view only shows the shared tasks that the
      current workbench user can delete. For the administrator, this is all of
      the shared tasks; for a group leader, this is the shared tasks assigned to
      the groups led.</p>
      <h3>Tool Bar</h3>
      <p>The tool bar has the same buttons as in the <a href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">scheduler
      view</a>, and they too open a wizard. However, this wizard (described
      below) creates a shared task rather than a scheduled task.</p>
      <p>The tool bar menu contains the following items</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refresh this view from the collaboration server. (The view
          does not update automatically in response to changes on the server.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Shared Task List</h3>
      <p>The columns in this list show the shared task icon and name, the
      frequency with which it will be run, and who created the task. If open,
      the properties view shows additional information about the selected task,
      such as to whom it is assigned.</p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">The context menu contains the following items
            <ul>
              <li><b>New Task</b> - This sub-menu gives the types of shared tasks that
                can be created. These are the same as in the <a href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">scheduled
                task view</a>.</li>
              <li><b>Edit</b> - Edit the selected task.</li>
              <li><b>Delete</b> - Delete the selected tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</td>
          <td valign="top"><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/shared_task_view_menu.gif" width="302" height="306"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Shared Task Wizard</h3>
      <p>The wizard for creating shared tasks is almost identical to that for
      creating <a href="../scheduler/scheduler_schedule.html">scheduled tasks</a>.
      The only difference is an additional page specifically for setting the
      attributes of the shared task.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/collaboration/shared_task_wizard.gif" width="485" height="549"></p>
      <p>The users and groups tabs show the assignees for the task. The <b>Lock
      task</b> check box specifies whether the task is locked. The <b>Hide task</b>
      check box specifies whether the task is hidden. A hidden task is not
      displayed in the scheduled task view of an assignee's workbench.</td>
  </tr>

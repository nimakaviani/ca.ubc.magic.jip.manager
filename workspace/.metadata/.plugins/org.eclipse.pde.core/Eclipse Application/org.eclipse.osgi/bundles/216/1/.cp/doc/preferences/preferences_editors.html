    <p>This page is used to control various CodePro editor options.</p>
    <h3>Pin dirty editors</h3>
    <p>When single-click editing is effect (standard within the VisualAge Java Workbench
    perspective), clicking on a type will change the contents of the current code editor to
    reflect the new selection. If an editor is &quot;pinned&quot;, a new editor is opened
    rather than changing the contents of the existing editor. If an editor is
    &quot;dirty&quot; (e.g., there are unsaved changes), normally the user will be presented
    with a &quot;Save Changes?&quot; dialog where they are given the opportunity to save
    changes before the contents of the editor are changed. With this option in effect, dirty
    editors are automatically considered &quot;pinned&quot; and their contents will not be
    replaced and no question will be asked of the user.</p>
    <h3><a name="AutoFormat"></a>Format on save</h3>
    <p>This options determines whether Java source is automatically formatted during the
    save
    process.
    <h3><a name="OrganizeImports"></a>Organize Imports on save</h3>
      <p>This options determines whether imports are automatically organized during the
      save
    process.
    <h3>Show task list if errors</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether the standard task view will be automatically brought to
    the front any time a compilation error is encountered when saving a Java type.
    This option is only available under Eclipse 2.0 and Application Developer
    5.0.</p>
    <h3><a name="AutoSave"></a>Save all editors</h3>
    <p>This option determines whether the open editors will be saved automatically on a
    user-specified schedule (default is every ten minutes). Note that this option schedules a
    special system task to run at the specified interval. <em>This feature is only available
    under Eclipse 2.0 and Application Developer 5.0.</em></p>
    <h3>Single-click editor access</h3>
    <p>This checkbox list is used to specify which perspectives should have single-click
    editor access enabled for them. This is on by default for the VisualAge Java Workbench
    perspective. When single-click editing is in effect, clicking on a type will change the
    contents of the current code editor to reflect the new selection. Holding down the ALT key
    when you single click will open the file in a new editor rather than reusing an existing
    editor.</td>

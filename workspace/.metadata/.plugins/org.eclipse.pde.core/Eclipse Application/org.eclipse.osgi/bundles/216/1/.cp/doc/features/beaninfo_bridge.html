      <p>Neither WebSphere Studio Application Developer 4.0 nor Eclipse 2.x includes a BeanInfo editor. The BeanInfo Bridge feature allows you
    to access the VA Java BeanInfo editor from within Application
      Developer/Eclipse by simply clicking on a class or
    compilation unit and selecting the &quot;Edit BeanInfo&quot; command. Technically, this
    involves quite a bit of cooperative magic between Application
      Developer/Eclipse and VA Java.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1) If VA Java isn't running, Eclipse will start it up in &quot;slave mode&quot;<ul>
        <li>any version of VA Java will do, so you could install VA Java Entry for this purpose
          alone</li>
        <li>VA Assist
          needs to be installed in VA Java for all of the VA Java pieces to work. VA Assist should
          be configured
          to point to your Application Developer/Eclipse root directory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>2) Once started, a bi-directional socket connection is established between VA Java and
      Application Developer/Eclipse<ul>
        <li>if VAJ was already running, it will establish communications with that VA Java instance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3) Application Developer/Eclipse sends the code for the class to VA Java</p>
      <p>4) The VA Java BeanInfo editor opens up on the code<ul>
        <li>the matching *BeanInfo class is sent over to VAJ as well</li>
      </ul>
      <p>5) You edit the class using the normal BeanInfo editor tools<ul>
        <li>the tool is presented &quot;standalone&quot; and doesn't provide access to any other VA
          Java facilities/browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>6) When you are done editing, the new code is generated and sent back over to
      Application Developer/Eclipse</p>
      <p>7) When Application Developer/Eclipse shuts down, it will automatically shutdown VA Java as well</p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>All of the CodePro / VA Assist integration features may be configured via the
    &quot;<a href="../preferences/preferences_vaassist.html">CodePro | VA Assist</a>&quot;
    options page. On the VA Java side, the Application Developer/Eclipse integration features may be configured
    via the &quot;VA Assist | Application Developer/Eclipse&quot; options page.<br>

    <td valign="top" align="left" style="padding-right: 20">Yes. ClearCase
    uses a pessimistic &quot;check-in/check-out&quot; model. Many operations in
      Application Developer/Eclipse will
    fail unless a type is properly checked out before editing (refactoring, for example). The
    same is true for specific CodePro features such as the <a href="vce_bridge.html">VCE
    Bridge</a> and BeanInfo Bridge. In order for the &quot;Edit GUI&quot; and &quot;Edit
    BeanInfo&quot; commands to work, make sure that the class that you plan to edit has been
    properly checked out from ClearCase.<br>

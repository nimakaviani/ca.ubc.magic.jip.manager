    <p><a name="MetricSet"></a>The <b> Metrics</b> page displays the selected <b>metric set</b>
    along with a list of all of the <a
    href="../features/metrics/metrics_details.html">metrics</a> that are 
    available.&nbsp; There is always exactly one default metric set denoted 
    by an asterisk following the name of the metric set, and it is used when 
    selecting <img src="../images/metrics_icon.gif" width="16" height="16"
    alt="metrics_icon.gif (156 bytes)">  <a href="../features/metrics/metrics.html"><b>Compute Metrics</b></a> in the
    <b> 
    CodePro Tools</b> menu.&nbsp; To display the enabled metrics
    and their parameters for a particular metric set, select that metric
    set in the metric set dropdown list above the list of metrics.</p>
      <p>The <b><a name="FindRule">Find Metric</a></b> button provides a quick way
      to find various metrics. Entering a keyword in the top entry field
      will cause any metric with that word in its name or description to be
      shown in the middle list. Selecting a metric in the list will show
      its description in the bottom pane. Clicking the <b>OK</b> button will
      close the dialog and set the selection of the metrics tree to the chosen metric.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/preferences_metrics_find_metric.gif"></p>
      <p>Within each metric set, each metric can be individually enabled 
    or disabled by clicking on the check box beside the name of the metric.&nbsp; The
      <b> Parameters</b> page 
    (shown above) allows you to edit the configuration parameters and bounds of the selected
    metric. Some metrics may not have any parameters.&nbsp; The <b> <a name="Description"> Description</a></b> page (shown below) displays the metric ID
      and a brief description of what the selected metric will calculate when a metric analysis is performed.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_metrics_description.gif"></p>
    <p>When the menu item <img src="../images/metrics_icon.gif" width="16" height="16"
    alt="metrics_icon.gif (166 bytes)">  <b>Compute Metrics</b> is selected, the enabled <a
    href="../features/metrics/metrics_details.html">metrics</a> will be computed. The results
    will be displayed in the <a href="../features/metrics/metrics.html">Metrics view</a>. </p>
      <p><a name="Manage"></a>The <b>Metric Sets</b> page shows a list of all of the
      metric sets that are defined. Use the <b>New</b> button to create a new
      metric set, the <b>Copy</b> button to copy and existing metric set and the <b>Delete</b> button to delete an existing metric set.&nbsp;
      The <b>Set Default</b> button makes the currently selected metric set 
    into the default metric set. The <b><a name="Hide">Hide</a></b> button hides the selected
    metric sets from view elsewhere in the product. The <b>Show</b> button
    restores them.<p><img src="../images/preferences_metrics_metricsets.gif"><p><a name="Export"></a>The
      <b>Export</b> button is used to export one or more metric sets to an
      XML-based preference file. At the bottom of the wizard page, is an area for selecting the location to which the
    preference file should be exported. The first option, &quot;File System&quot; allows the
    user to export the metric set to any arbitrary location in the file system. It defaults
    to \preferences\metrics.pref. The second option, &quot;Project&quot;, allows the user to store the
      metric set to a
    project loaded in their workspace. This makes it easy to put the metric
      set file under
    some form of source code control such as CVS, PVCS or ClearCase. The third option, &quot;Server&quot;, can be used only if a <a href="../features/collaboration/server.html">collaboration
      server</a> has been specified in the <a href="preferences_collaboration.html">preferences</a>.
      It allows the user to store the preferences on the <a href="../features/collaboration/server.html">collaboration
      server</a>. The wizard automatically remembers the last path used. The fourth option, &quot;User&quot;, allows the user to send preferences to other users without intervention
      by the receiving user. Thus, this option provides a way to silently set
      preferences in the workbenches of other users. This can only be done for <a href="../features/collaboration/users_view.html">users</a>
      and <a href="../features/collaboration/groups_view.html">groups</a> led by the
      user, unless the user is the administrator, in which case it can be done
      for any user or group. Metric
      sets may be exported in <a name="locked"> locked</a> or unlocked format. If a locked metric
      set is imported, it may not be modified.
    <p><img src="../images/metrics_export.gif"><p><a name="Import"></a>The
      <b>Import</b> button is used to import one or more metrics from an
      XML-based preference file. At the top of the dialog, is an area for selecting the location
    from which the metric file should be imported. The first option, &quot;File
    System&quot; allows the user to import the metrics from any arbitrary location in the
    file system. It defaults to \preferences\metrics.pref. The second option, &quot;Project&quot;, allows the
    user to load metrics from a project loaded in their workspace. The third option, &quot;Server&quot;, can be used
    only if a <a href="../features/collaboration/server.html">collaboration server</a>
    has been specified in the <a href="preferences_collaboration.html">preferences</a>.
    This option allows the user to load preferences from the <a href="../features/collaboration/server.html">collaboration
    server</a>. The wizard automatically remembers the last path used.
    <p><img src="../images/metrics_import.gif">
      <p><a name="General"></a>The <b>General</b> page controls various options concerning
      the maximum number of metric result sets, whether to include subpackages, the
    presentation of bounds violations and whether to automatically refresh metrics result sets.
      The <b>Limit the number of result sets</b> option sets the maximum number
      of result sets. Each result set consumes memory, so this number should be
      kept low. Once the maximum is reached, any new ones will eliminate the
      oldest result set. The <b>Include subpackages of selected packages</b>
      option controls whether subpackages are included in the analysis. The <b>Violated
      Bounds</b> option controls the color used to display metrics that violate
      their bounds.&nbsp; The <b>Automatically refresh metrics when selecting a set</b>
    option will cause metrics result sets to be refreshed automatically when
    switching between them.
    <p><img src="../images/preferences_metrics_general.gif"> 
      <p><a name="HTML"></a>The <b> Reports</b> page controls various options concerning the
      contents of the HTML and XML Metrics reports. The <b>Include metrics for
      sub-scopes </b>option
      controls whether sub-scope detail information is included in the report. The <b>Include metrics for types </b>option
      controls whether type detail information is included in the report. The <b>Include
      details</b> option determines whether metric detail information is
      included for most metrics. Finally, the <b>Include violation </b>summary
      option (HTML-only) controls whether a violation summary section is included at the end
      of the report.

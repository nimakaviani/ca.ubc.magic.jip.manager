    <p>Select the &quot;Perspective | Open&quot; command and choose &quot;VisualAge Java
    Workbench&quot;. This will open a new perspective with three views - Java Projects,
    Java Packages
    and Outline - stacked up horizontally across the top of the window, a editing area in the
    middle, and the standard Eclipse Task, Search &amp; Console views at the bottom (plus our <a
    href="../scheduler/scheduler.html">Scheduler view</a>). The default orientation used by
    the perspective - vertical or horizontal - can be set on the <a href="../../preferences/preferences_browsers.html">Browsers</a> options page.
    <i>Note: The Packages view is not available under Eclipse 3.0.</i>
    </p>
    <p>In vertical mode, the Projects, Packages and Outline view will be stacked up on the
    left side of the window. These three views may also be dragged around and repositioned in
    true Eclipse style. The Packages view will automatically flip from horizontal to vertical
    orientation based upon its dimensions.</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

    <p><a name="singleclick"></a>All of these views support the VA Java
    &quot;click-to-edit&quot; style of editing rather than the Eclipse
    &quot;double-click-to-edit&quot; style. This makes it very easy to navigate in the system
    in a manner similar to VA Java. If you need to see more than one editor, you can click on
    the current editor and select the &quot;Pin Editor&quot; command from the Window menu or
    click the <img src="../../images/pin_editor.gif" width="16" height="16"> toolbar button to
    lock that editor into place. Holding down the ALT key when you &quot;click-to-edit&quot;
    is another way to open a file in a new editor rather than reusing an existing editor.</p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top" align="center"><img src="../../images/pin_editor_menu.gif" width="111"
        height="54"><p><img src="../../images/pin_editor.gif" width="16" height="16"></td>
        <td valign="top">The next type you click on will then open a new editor. That new editor
        window will dynamically update its contents as different classes are clicked on (unless it
        too is &quot;pinned&quot;). This gives you the best of both worlds - the VAJ single-click
        style with the ability to open multiple editors when necessary. <p>If an editor is
        &quot;dirty&quot; (e.g., there are unsaved changes), normally the user will be presented
        with a &quot;Save Changes?&quot; dialog where they are given the opportunity to save
        changes before the contents of the editor are changed. With the &quot;<a
        href="../../preferences/preferences_editors.html">Auto-pin dirty editors</a>&quot; option
        in effect, dirty editors are automatically considered &quot;pinned&quot; and their
        contents will not be replaced and no question will be asked of the user.</td>

    <p><a href="../wizards/working_set.html" name="views"></a>The Java Projects and
    Java Packages views
    initially open to show only the packages defined in your projects. If you select the view
    drop down &quot;Show Referenced Libraries&quot; option, you will see all of the referenced
    packages as well. By default, only standard Java elements will be shown. Selecting the
    &quot;Show Resources&quot; filter will reveal your non-Java elements as well (e.g., image
    files, HTML files, text files, etc.). Also, inner classes are shown nested under their
    parents in standard VA Java style.</p>
    <p><a name="workingset"></a>In addition, you have access to <a
    href="../wizards/working_set.html">working set filters</a> which will allow you to further
    customize which Java elements you see. The &quot;Select Working Set&quot; option allows
    you to select a working set as a filter or define a new one. The &quot;Deselect
    Working Set&quot; option removes any assigned working set filter.</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/vaj_perspective_projects.gif" width="760" height="531"></p>
    <p>In the Packages view, you also have the choice of viewing the packages in a flat or
    tree list and can toggle between the two views at any time. <i>Note: The
    Packages view is not available under Eclipse 3.0.</i></p>

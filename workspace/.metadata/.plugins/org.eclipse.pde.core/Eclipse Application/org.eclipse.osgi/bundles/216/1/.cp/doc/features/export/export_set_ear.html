    <p>The &quot;Add Export Operation&quot; wizard pages for the &quot;EAR file&quot;
    operation are identical to those one would find in the standard export wizard if one
    were starting a EAR file export manually. The only difference is that the
    &quot;Finish&quot; button is used to save the export operation rather than execute it
    immediately.<p>An <a href="../ant/ExportEARToEarFile.html">
    codepro.exportEARToEarFile</a> Ant task is used to record the options chosen and 
    perform the operation as part of an Export Set.</td>

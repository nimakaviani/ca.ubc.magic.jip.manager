      <p>To schedule a Load Projects task to
    be run at a specified time, open the <a href="scheduler.html">scheduler view</a>,
    right-click to access the popup menu, select the &quot;New&quot; submenu, and then select
    &quot;Load Projects&quot;.&nbsp; This opens the scheduler wizard so that
      load projects operation may be configured. Any shared projects may be
      selected to be loaded into the workspace. Options are provided to control
      the behavior when the projects are already loaded in the workspace. You
      can choose to always overwrite the existing projects, prompt before
      overwriting, or not overwrite any existing projects.</p>
      <p>Note that when this task is used as a <a href="../collaboration/shared_task_view.html">globally
      shared task</a>, it provides a way to remotely control the project
      configuration of one or more workspaces. This can only be done for <a href="../collaboration/users_view.html">users</a>
      and <a href="../collaboration/groups_view.html">groups</a> led by the
      user, unless the user is the administrator, in which case it can be done
      for any user or group.</p>
    <p>Click the &quot;<a href="scheduler_schedule.html">Next &gt;</a>&quot; button to
    schedule when the message is to be displayed.</td>

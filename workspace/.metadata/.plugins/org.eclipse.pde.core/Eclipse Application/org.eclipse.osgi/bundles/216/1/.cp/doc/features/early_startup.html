        <p>Eclipse is based upon the lazy loading principal, meaning that the 
        plugins that comprise Eclipse and Eclipse add-ons are not loaded until 
        explicitly needed by Eclipse. For example, if a plugin A provides 
        function X tied to menu item Y, then plugin A is not loaded until the 
        user selects menu item Y.</p>
        <p>Some plugins provide functionality that needs to be loaded and 
        executed when Eclipse is launched to function properly. For example, if 
        a plugin provides a scheduler service that executes tasks at predefined 
        intervals, then it must be loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched 
        so that scheduled tasks will be run at the appropriate times. To this 
        end, Eclipse provides the org.eclipse.ui.startup extension point for 
        early startup. Any plugin extending to this extension point will be 
        loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched.</p>
        <p>CodePro provides several features that, if enabled, need to be loaded 
        and executed when Eclipse itself is launched. In order to minimize the 
        startup time and only load necessary plugins, CodePro has a very small 
        startup plugin extending the Eclipse org.eclipse.ui.startup extension 
        point so that it is loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched. This 
        very small startup plugin in turn loads and executes other CodePro 
        plugins if they are needed when Eclipse is launched. This approach 
        minimizes the impact of CodePro on startup time and memory footprint for 
        functionality that is not required.</p>
        <h2><a href="scheduler/scheduler.html">Scheduler</a></h2>
        <p>The CodePro Task Scheduler provides a facility for scheduling various 
        tasks to occur at startup, at shutdown, at scheduled times or in 
        response to specific events. In order for these tasks to be executed at 
        the appropriate times, this plugin must be loaded and executed. If at 
        least one scheduled task exists, then this plugin notifies the CodePro 
        startup plugin that it needs to be loaded and executed whenever Eclipse 
        is launched. If there are no scheduled tasks or all scheduled tasks have 
        been deleted, then this plugin notifies the CodePro startup plugin that 
        it does <b>not </b>need to be loaded and executed when Eclipse is 
        launched.</p>
        <h2><a href="collaboration/configuration_wizard.html">Collaboration</a></h2>
        <p dir="ltr">The Collaboration Configuration Wizard is used to establish 
        a connection to a collaboration server and choose (or create) an 
        identity on that collaboration server. CodePro communicates with the 
        collaboration server via polling. In order for this communication to 
        occur at the appropriate time, the collaboration plugin must be loaded 
        and executed when Eclipse is launched. If a collaboration server is 
        specified, then this plugin notifies the CodePro startup plugin that it 
        needs to be loaded and executed whenever Eclipse is launched. If no 
        collaboration server is specified then this plugin notifies the CodePro 
        startup plugin that it does <b>not </b>need to be loaded and executed 
        when Eclipse is launched.</p>
        <h2 dir="ltr"><a href="java_history.html">Java History</a> and
        <a href="modified_types.html">Modified Types</a></h2>
        <p dir="ltr">The CodePro Java History and Modified Type views track all 
        types that have been accessed and all modifications or additions made to 
        various types within the workspace. In order that CodePro track modified 
        types, this plugin must be loaded and executed when Eclipse is launched. 
        If either the <a href="../preferences/preferences_history.html"><b>Track 
        modified elements</b> or <b>Track history</b> preferences</a> are turned 
        on, then this plugin notifies the CodePro startup plugin that it needs 
        to be loaded and executed whenever Eclipse is launched. If neither of 
        these preferences are selected then this plugin notifies the CodePro 
        startup plugin that it does <b>not </b>need to be loaded and executed 
        when Eclipse is launched.</p>

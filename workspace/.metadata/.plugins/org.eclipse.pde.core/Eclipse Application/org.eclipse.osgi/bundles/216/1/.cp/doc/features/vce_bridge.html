    <p><em> This feature requires that VA
    Assist be installed into VisualAge Java. VA Assist can be
    downloaded and installed from here.</em></p>

    <p>Eclipse does not include a GUI builder. The VCE Bridge feature allows you to access the VA Java VCE (Visual
    Composition Editor) from within Application Developer or
    Eclipse by simply clicking on a class or
    compilation unit and selecting the &quot;Edit GUI&quot; command. Technically, this
    involves quite a bit of cooperative magic between Application Developer/Eclipse and VA Java.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1) If VA Java isn't running, Application Developer/Eclipse will start it up in &quot;slave mode&quot;<ul>
        <li>any version of VA Java will do, so you could install VA Java Entry for this purpose
          alone</li>
        <li>VA Assist
          needs to be installed in VA Java for all of the VA Java pieces to work. VA Assist should
          be configured
          to point to your Application Developer/Eclipse root directory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>2) Once started, a bi-directional socket connection is established between VA Java and
      Application Developer/Eclipse<ul>
        <li>if VAJ was already running, it will establish communications with that VA Java instance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3) Eclipse sends the code for the class to VA Java</p>
      <p>4) The VA Java VCE opens up on the code<ul>
        <li>the layout info is retrieved from the class's <strong>getBuilderData()</strong> method</li>
      </ul>
      <p>5) You edit the class using the normal VCE tools<ul>
        <li>you are limited to widgets known to VA Java 3.x/4.x (and JDK 1.2.2 features)</li>
        <li>the tool is presented &quot;standalone&quot; and doesn't provide access to any other VA
          Java facilities/browsers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>6) When you are done editing, the new code is generated and sent back over to
      Application Developer/Eclipse</p>
      <p>7) If you click on the VCE run or debug buttons, the code will be generated, sent to
      Application Developer/Eclipse and then run in that context</p>
      <p>8) When Application Developer/Eclipse shuts down, it will automatically shutdown VA Java as well</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The obvious limitation here is that you are limited to JDK 1.2.2 features. Since this
    facility is meant to &quot;bridge&quot; folks from VA Java into Application
    Developer/Eclipse until the
    corresponding Eclipse facility is released, it should be viewed as short term and tactical
    in nature. Once an Application Developer/Eclipse native VCE is released, you would no longer need to use
    this VCE Bridge feature.</p>
      <p>All of the CodePro / VA Assist integration features may be configured via the
    &quot;<a href="../preferences/preferences_vaassist.html">CodePro | VA Assist</a>&quot;
    options page. On the VA Java side, the Application Developer/Eclipse integration features may be configured
    via the &quot;VA Assist | Application Developer/Eclipse&quot; options page.<br>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="left" style="padding-right: 20">VA Java does not
    recreate the VCE layout information from the source of the class. Rather, it stores that
    meta data within the repository. VA Java does provide a source code generation option for
    generating that meta data into a special <strong>getBuilderData()</strong> method. That
    method must be present in any exported class for it to be properly edited using the VA
    Java VCE and, consequently, the VCE Bridge. Rather than forcing you to go back an
    regenerate all of the source for your GUI classes, VA Assist provides a convenient &quot;Generate
    missing meta data methods on export&quot; option that will cause those missing methods
    to be generated any time a class is exported either to a directory
    or directly to Application Developer/Eclipse.<br>

    <th valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">If my GUI references any
      custom components, do those components need to be loaded into VA Java
      before editing the class with the VCE Bridge?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="left">Yes. Any custom parts or nested components
      need to be present within VA Java. All you need to do is load the VA Java
      project containing the referenced components before invoking the <a href="vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>.
      One of the basic assumptions of the <a href="vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a>
      is that you are editing GUI classes originally created in VA Java so you
      would have those pieces available already in VA Java. If you load your VA
      Java projects into VA Java, that should solve any dependency problems that
      you might have.
      <p>The VA Java GUI builder only knows about types within its environment.
      If you want to use classes that you have created in Eclipse, you will need
      to import them into the VA Java environment you want to use. The direct
      import from Eclipse option that has been added to the Import
      Wizard by VA Assist
      should make that easy. If you plan to do this frequently, you might want
      to set up an Eclipse
      Import set on the VA Java side and use the Task
      Scheduler to have it run automatically at VA Java startup. That way,
      whenever you invoke the <a href="vce_bridge.html">VCE Bridge</a> it will
      automatically import your new/changed beans and make them available for
      use.<br>

    <td valign="top" align="left">Here are some questions to ask yourself and

      <ol>
        <li>Do you have VA Assist installed into VA Java. What version of VA
          Assist are you using?</li>
        <li>Is CodePro configured to talk to your VA Java installation?<br>
          <a href="../preferences/preferences_vaassist.html">../preferences/preferences_vaassist.html</a></li>
        <li>Is VA Assist in VAJ configured to know about your Eclipse
          installation?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sending us a screen shot of both of the above screens in your
      environment might help us identify the problem. Are any exceptions
      recorded either into the VA Java &quot;ide\program\va-debug.log&quot;
      file, the Eclipse &quot;&lt;workspace&gt;\.metadata\.log&quot; file or the
      &quot;&lt;workspace&gt;\.metadata\.plugins\com.instantiations.assist.eclipse.core\ws-debug.log&quot;
      file? If so, please send us those files. If none are recorded, you can try
      turning on the &quot;log communications&quot; options in both products
      which will cause communication status messages to be recorded to the log
      files which should help us analyze the problem.<br>

    <th valign="top" align="left" style="padding-right: 20" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">Are there any
    special considerations when using ClearCase?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="left" style="padding-right: 20">Yes. ClearCase
    uses a pessimistic &quot;check-in/check-out&quot; model. Many operations in
      Application Developer/Eclipse will
    fail unless a type is properly checked out before editing (refactoring, for example). The
    same is true for specific CodePro features such as the VCE Bridge and <a
    href="beaninfo_bridge.html">BeanInfo Bridge</a>. In order for the &quot;Edit GUI&quot; and
    &quot;Edit BeanInfo&quot; commands to work, make sure that the class that you plan to edit
    has been properly checked out from ClearCase.<br>

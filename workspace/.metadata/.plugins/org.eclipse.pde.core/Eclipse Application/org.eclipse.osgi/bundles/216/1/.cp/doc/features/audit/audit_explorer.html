        The <b>Audit Explorer</b> displays the resources created by and associated with
        the <a href="audit.html">code audit</a> feature. There are two kinds of
        resources that are currently displayed in the <b>Audit Explorer</b>.

            An audit result set is the set of violations resulting from auditing
            a set of resources. The violations in an audit result set can be
            viewed in the <a href="audit.html"><b>Audit </b>view</a>.

            An audit series is a report based on a series of audit result sets.
            An audit series can be opened in an 
			<a href="audit_series_editor.html">
            <b>Audit Series</b> editor</a> to allow the report to be configured, and
            can also be used to generate an <a href="audit_series_report.html">HTML</a> representation of the report.
            To open an audit series editor, double click on the audit series in
            this view.

        The resources displayed in this view are grouped into storage locations
        based on where the resources reside. There are two kinds of storage
        locations.

          <p>
            There is a single workspace location that is accessible to only the
            current workspace. The workspace location is where new resources
            are created by default. For example, when an audit is manually
            performed, the audit result set is placed in the workspace location.<br>

        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            There is a project location for each project that is currently
            loaded in the workspace. The project location is physically located
            within the directory structure containing the project, so it can be
            shared by all of the developers that have that project loaded. (The
            storage location for projects is located within a directory named
            <code>.codepro</code> found at the top level of the project
            directory.)
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a <a href="#action_filter">filter option</a> that controls
            the visibility of project locations that are either empty or
            non-existent. If a project does not appear in the tree, check the
            setting of this option.

        The resources displayed in this view can be copied and moved to other
        locations using the standard drag-drop gestures for the current
        platform.

      <p>
        Right-clicking on a resource will display the following menu:

      </p>

        The <b>Create Series</b> menu item will create a new audit series in the
        currently selected location (if a location is selected) or the location
        containing the currently selected resource (if a resource is selected).
        If a single audit result set is selected, then the newly created series
        will be initialized to contain the selected result set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Generate HTML...</b> menu item will cause an
		<a href="audit_series_report.html">HTML report</a> to be
        generated from the currently selected audit series. You will be prompted
        for the location of the HTML file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Delete</b> menu item will cause the currently selected resources to
        be deleted from the external storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Select All</b> menu item will cause all of the resources to be
        selected.

21 May 2012:

I have completed almost all of the GUI elements. Now I need to port over the system
functionality. I have copied over the models, because those I should be able to work
with wholesale. The next part is to add the connection between the GUI and the
model itself, with as little new code as possible.

Once the port is done perhaps I can refactor.

Stay calm and carry on: I will start by porting the BrowsePathAction class.

Miniature MVC for starters: setting the snapshot data:
	1) controller gets a reference to a view; this is used whenever the
	controller is notified of a change in a model
	2) controller obtains a reference to a model; this is used to change
	something when the view indicates
	3) controller registers itself as a listener on the model's state

20 May 2012:

I want to both get things done and learn new techniques. Once I have figured out
how to do something, I need to immediately look up how to do it better.

Later on I may try out the SWTXML project on Google code.

Today, since I have laid out the primary design of the user interface, I will now
refactor. I may need to refactor once more once the MVC is decided on.

One of the things I will need to learn is how to use resources, so that the 
contents and the layout of the GUI can be separated.

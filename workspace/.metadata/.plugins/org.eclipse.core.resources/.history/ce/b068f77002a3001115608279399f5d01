20 May 2012:

I want to both get things done and learn new techniques. Once I have figured out
how to do something, I need to immediately look up how to do it better.

Later on I may try out the SWTXML project on Google code.

Today, since I have laid out the primary design of the user interface, I will now
refactor. I may need to refactor once more once the MVC is decided on.
